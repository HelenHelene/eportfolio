# Scanning and Collaborative Wiki Activity

Using the website(s) [Gin & Juice Shop Ecommerce](https://ginandjuice.shop/) assigned in Unit 1, carry out the following exercise and answer the questions listed below.

Your results and responses should be posted on the wiki, created by you and your fellow students. As this is a wiki activity, please see [guidance here on using a wiki](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Wiki_activity) on the Moodle platform.

Note: this is a collaborative exercise, please only add to the wiki and do not delete other student's work.

### Instructions
Perform scans against your assigned website(s) using the tools available in Kali Linux. Answer as many of the following questions as you can:
 - What Operating System does the website utilise?
 - What web server software is it running?
 - Is it running a CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc?)
 - What protection does it have (CDN, Proxy, Firewall?)
 - Where is it hosted?
 - Does it have any open ports? Which did you expect to be open?
 - Does the site have any known vulnerabilities?
 - What versions of software is it using? Are these patched so that they are up to date?

The wiki should consist of two sections:
 - The first section should be a FAQ (frequently asked questions) where you can post questions. In addition, if you have encountered and solved any of the questions/ issues, you should post your responses to the queries.
 - The second section involves the results - each of you should post a compilation of the results they have obtained in the wiki. Doing so will allow your fellow students to evaluate the kind of results available and ask questions (in the FAQ section) about how certain results were obtained. Offer constructive feedback on the results posted.

### Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
 - Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.
 - Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.

### Reflections
Reflect on this activity by answering the following questions:
 - Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?
 - How did you overcome them?
 - How will they affect your final report?
