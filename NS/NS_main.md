# Module 3 Network Security

This module focuses on understanding the impact of cyber security on network systems and designs, specifically through network vulnerability assessments. It covers a range of techniques for scanning, evaluating, and mitigating network vulnerabilities, while also providing a solid understanding of vulnerability assessment basics in different systems. Additionally, it offers knowledge about protocols, architectures, monitoring tools, and security vulnerability assessment tools commonly used in network systems.

There are three assignments in this module. The first assignment involves conducting a Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Baseline Analysis and Plan. In this assignment, students analyze network vulnerabilities in detail and develop a plan for assessing them. The second assignment requires students to present the results of the vulnerability assessment in the form of an Executive Summary. Lastly, students are expected to submit an Individual Reflective Piece, reflecting on their personal development throughout the module.
