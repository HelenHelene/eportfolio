# Unit 2: Advanced Persistent Threats: Applying the Cyber Kill Chain Model to a Case Study

In this unit, we had the opportunity to delve deeper into the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al., 2011) and apply it to a real-world case study—the SolarWinds exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021). 
The objective was to assess the relevance and effectiveness of the Cyber Kill Chain model in analyzing modern Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout this unit, we achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - explain the different stages of the kill chain and how they interconnect to facilitate a successful APT.
 - gained the ability to dissect a real-world case study using the Cyber Kill Chain model, allowing us to identify the attack's progression and potential vulnerabilities.
 - suggest proactive measures and countermeasures to minimize the impact of APTs and prevent similar breaches.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I actively participated in collaborative discussions and completed the assigned activities.

### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I realize the critical nature of advanced persistent threats and the ongoing need for robust security measures. 
The knowledge gained from studying the Cyber Kill Chain model and analyzing real-world case studies will undoubtedly enhance my understanding of APTs and enable me to contribute effectively to mitigating future threats.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Moving forward, I will continue to build upon the knowledge and skills acquired in this unit. 
I plan to further explore additional case studies, participate in practical exercises, and stay updated with the latest advancements in APT detection and prevention techniques. 
By doing so, I aim to become a proficient and vigilant professional in the field of cybersecurity, well-equipped to combat the ever-evolving landscape of advanced persistent threats.
