# Case Study: Reviewing an Assessment Reporting Template

### Introduction

This tasked is reviewing the [assessment template from PurpleSec](NS_Unit05_SampleReport.pdf) and answer the following question:

1. Does this template meet the NCSC stated requirement of preparing a baseline to use as a reference point for pen tests? If not what changes/amendments would you make?
   - The provided template does create a detailed report of vulnerabilities which can be used as a baseline for future pen tests. However, it could be improved in the following ways to better align with NCSC requirements:
       - Add a Baseline Section: Introduce a section explicitly labeled as "Baseline Assessment" that summarizes the current security posture.
       - Historical Comparison: Include a comparison with previous assessment results to highlight improvements or regressions.
       - Pen Test Preparation: Add a section detailing how the findings will inform the scope and focus areas for future penetration tests.

2. What are the two best lessons/examples presented in the report?
   - Detailed Severity Classification: The report's categorization of vulnerabilities into critical, high, medium, and low severity provides a clear prioritization framework, which is crucial for effective remediation planning.
   - Specific Recommendations for Patching: The inclusion of specific solutions, such as applying KB articles or upgrading software, offers actionable guidance for addressing vulnerabilities.

3. What two things do you think are unnecessary or could be done more effectively?
   - Redundant Information in the Executive Summary: The Executive Summary reiterates some details found in other sections. This could be streamlined to provide a high-level overview without repeating specifics.
   - Methodology Explanation: While the methodology section is important, it could be condensed. Instead, provide an appendix for those who need detailed process explanations and keep the main report concise.


### Reflections
1. Did you have any issues or challenges with this activity?
    - One challenge was ensuring that the recommendations for improving the template aligned with NCSC requirements, which required a lot of research into the NCSC guidelines.

2. How did you overcome them?
   - By focusing on general best practices for vulnerability assessments and using common standards for security reporting, I could infer necessary enhancements.

3. How will they affect your final report?
    - These insights will help ensure the final report is both comprehensive and aligned with industry standards, making it a more effective tool for ongoing security management and future pen testing preparations.
