# Vulnerability Analysis â€“ Scanning Activity

### Instructions
Using the website(s) [Gin & Juice Shop Ecommerce](https://ginandjuice.shop/) assigned in Unit 1, carry out the following exercises and answer the questions listed below. 
Perform a basic scan using standard tools such as traceroute, dig and nslookup. 
Please see these [instructions on using traceroute, etc](https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/internet-and-networking/troubleshooting-network-connectivity-with-ping-and-traceroute/).  
Do not use ping as it will cause confusion because of shared addresses.

Use these basic tools and make a list that details the following information:
 - How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?
 - Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?
 - What are the main nameservers for the website?
 - Who is the registered contact?
 - What is the MX record for the website?
 - Where is the website hosted?

### Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
 - Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.
 - Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.

### Reflections
Reflect on this activity by answering the following questions:
 - Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?
 - How did you overcome them?
 - How will they affect your final report?
