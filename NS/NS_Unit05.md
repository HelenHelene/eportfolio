# Unit 5: Logging, Forensics and Future Trends

In Unit 5, we delved into two crucial topics for breach investigation and resolution: logging and forensics. 
We explored the distinctions between logging on Windows and Linux systems and examined essential tools used in logging. 
Additionally, we reviewed various forensic tools and the types of investigations that can be conducted using them.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout this unit, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:
 - gained an understanding of the logging configurations suitable for both Windows and Linux systems and learned how to configure logging effectively to capture relevant information for security monitoring and investigative purposes.
 - familiarized with a range of forensic tools available for conducting investigations. 
 - developed the ability to interpret and analyze the outcomes generated by log and forensic analysis tools.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I actively engaged in collaborative discussions and successfully completed the assigned activities.

### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I recognize the critical role of logging and forensics in breach investigations. 
The knowledge and skills gained in this unit have equipped me with the expertise to configure logging effectively, conduct thorough investigations using forensic tools, and analyze log and forensic analysis results to uncover significant findings.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
I plan to explore emerging trends and advancements in logging and forensics, staying updated with the latest tools and techniques. 
By doing so, I aim to enhance my ability to investigate and resolve security incidents effectively, ultimately contributing to the establishment of robust security measures.
