### Asset ID and Analysis Audit
#### Human Assets
- Website administrators
- Security personnel
- Developers
- Customer support staff

#### Web Assets
- Website front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Backend systems (APIs, database)
- User data and credentials
- Content management system (CMS)

#### Physical Assets
- Servers hosting the website
- Network infrastructure (routers, switches)
- Backup storage devices

### Identify Required Scans and Tools
#### Network Scans
To test for network vulnerabilities, the following tools should be used:
- **Traceroute**: To map the route packets take from the source to the destination.
- **Nmap**: To discover services and open ports on the network.
- **Nessus**: For comprehensive vulnerability scanning.
  
**Considerations**:
- **PING**: Useful for determining the availability of a host, but limited in shared hosting environments.
- **NMAP**: May provide misleading information for shared hosting IP addresses as it scans all services running on the host.

#### Host Scan
For auditing the underlying host:
- **HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System)**: Tools like Snort and Tripwire to monitor key system files for unauthorized changes.
- **Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM)**: For hardware audits and detecting unauthorized changes to BIOS or firmware.
- **Log Analysis**: Regular review of system and application logs.

#### Wireless Scans
Important for environments with mobile devices:
- **Kismet**: For wireless network scanning, sniffing, and acting as a wireless intrusion detection system.
- **Aircrack-ng**: For capturing and extracting keys and passphrases from encrypted wireless traffic.

#### Application Scanning/Management Tools
To manage and audit applications on the system:
- **Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM)**: For deploying and managing applications and group policies.
- **AppArmor**: On Unix-like systems to monitor and restrict application access.

### Core Software Network Components and Tools
- **PING**: To check host availability and round trip time.
- **Traceroute/Tracert**: To display the route between two hosts and calculate transit delays.
- **NSlookup**: To query DNS records.
- **DIG**: An advanced DNS query tool.
- **WHOIS**: To query Internet registrar databases.
- **Netstat**: To display active connections.
- **Internet/Web-based Services**: Use tools like ShieldsUp from GRC to test open ports and security of internet gateways/routers.
- **Web Spider**: To crawl through website pages and index or download HTML.

### Packet Diagnostic and Analysis Tools
- **TCPDump**: A Unix command-line tool for network packet analysis.
- **Wireshark**: A GUI-based tool for packet analysis, available on multiple platforms.

### Vulnerability and Port Scanners
- **Nmap**: For service and OS discovery as part of vulnerability scanning.
- **Nessus**: A commercial vulnerability scanner for multiple platforms.
- **OpenVAS**: An open-source vulnerability assessment system.
- **Kali Linux**: A Linux distribution with pre-packaged testing tools including Wireshark and Nmap.

### Integration with GRC Website Information
The Gibson Research Corporation (GRC) website offers several tools and resources that can aid in the security audit and vulnerability assessment of the Gin & Juice Shop website. Notable tools include:
- **ShieldsUP!**: To test for open ports and assess the security of internet gateways.
- **DNS Spoofability Test**: To check for DNS-related vulnerabilities.
- **Perfect Passwords**: To generate strong passwords for securing accounts.
- **Leaktest**: To check for potential data leaks.
- **Securable**: To assess the security capabilities of the system.

### Reflection on the Activity
#### Issues or Challenges with Literature Search/Audit
1. **Volume of Data**:
   - **Challenge**: The vast amount of data and reports on vulnerabilities made it challenging to filter relevant information specific to the Gin & Juice Shop website.
   - **Solution**: I focused on the vulnerabilities highlighted by OWASP Top 10 and CWE lists, which are commonly referenced for web applications.
2. **Relevance of Information**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring the information was up-to-date and relevant to the specific technologies used by the Gin & Juice Shop website.
   - **Solution**: Cross-referencing multiple sources, including the latest OWASP and CWE updates, helped validate the relevance of the information.
3. **Technical Jargon**:
   - **Challenge**: Understanding and interpreting technical terminologies and vulnerability details.
   - **Solution**: Utilizing glossaries from OWASP and CWE, and seeking clarification from additional reputable sources.

#### How Challenges Were Overcome
- **Focused Search Criteria**: Narrowing down search criteria to focus on web application security and prioritizing well-known vulnerabilities.
- **Utilizing Reliable Sources**: Relying on reputable sources like OWASP, CWE, and NVD to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.
- **Continuous Learning**: Leveraging online resources and communities to better understand complex terminologies and concepts.

#### Impact on Final Report
- **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: The challenges and the solutions implemented ensured a thorough and comprehensive risk assessment.
- **Accurate Recommendations**: The detailed understanding of vulnerabilities will lead to more accurate and actionable recommendations in the final report.
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Addressing identified vulnerabilities will significantly enhance the security posture of the Gin & Juice Shop website.
