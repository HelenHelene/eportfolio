### [Assignment 3: Individual Reflective Piece](Module03_Reflection.pdf)

<br>

#### Introduction
Reflecting on my journey through the Network Security module in the MSc Computer Science program, I find it both valuable and challenging. This module has increased my understanding of various professional terms and ethics in the field and has enriched my professional and personal development.

#### Summary of Learning Outcomes
During this module, I explored various aspects of network security, including legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by information security and risk professionals. The module covered techniques for scanning, evaluating, and mitigating network vulnerabilities, providing a solid understanding of vulnerability assessment basics, especially in web applications. Key assignments included conducting a Vulnerability Audit and Assessment, presenting the results in an Executive Summary, and reflecting on personal development.

The assignments required a deep dive into real-world applications of network security principles. For example, the first [Baseline Analysis and Plan assignment](NS_Assignment1.md) for the Gin & Juice Shop (G&J) project taught me how to analyze network vulnerabilities in detail and develop a comprehensive plan for assessment. The subsequent [Results and Executive Summary assignment](NS_Assignment2.md) helped me communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders effectively. These tasks, though challenging, provided invaluable insights into the practicalities of network security.

The formative activities, such as the [Literature Review Activity](NS_Unit02_LiteratureReview.md) in Unit 2 and the [Scanning Activity](NS_Unit03_Scanning.md) in Unit 3, provided a step-by-step approach to performing the vulnerability assessment for G&J. They also enhanced my technical skills for scanning and auditing and my understanding of compliance requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Before these activities and assignments, I was not aware of the accessibility requirements mentioned in WCAG. Now, it has become a practice for me when maintaining my e-portfolio during my MSc Computer Science journey.

This module also enhanced my awareness of ethical issues in vulnerability disclosure and the use of ethical hacking, emphasizing the importance of responsibility and accountability in all security practices.

Feedback from peers and tutors was crucial, enhancing my critical thinking and understanding of contemporary network security challenges. Collaborative discussions, such as those on the digital economy and log4j vulnerabilities, broadened my perspective. Tutor critiques on assignments refined my analytical and communication skills, improving my work quality.

#### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan (PDP)
All the professional skills I have gained, such as conducting network vulnerability assessments with various tools, drafting assessment reports and executive summaries, and understanding GDPR and WCAG, are invaluable.  Specifically, GDPR compliance is directly transferable to real-world scenarios in my current role as Data Protection Officer, where I can implement the strategies and tools learned during this module.  The knowledge of how to issue an assessment report makes it easier to facilitate communication between stakeholders and technical teams.
