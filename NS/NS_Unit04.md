# Unit 4: Breach Analysis and Mitigation

This week we focused on utilizing the techniques covered thus far to review, evaluate, and respond to security breaches. 
Additionally, we explored the suite of security assessment and testing tools available in the Kali Linux distribution.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout this unit, we achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - gained an understanding of the common techniques and methods employed by attackers during security breaches, allows us to recognize the various stages of an attack and comprehend the potential impact on an organization's security.
 - explored different strategies and countermeasures to mitigate the risks associated with security breaches. 
 - familiarized ourselves with the various security assessment and testing tools available in the Kali Linux distribution. 

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
I actively participated in collaborative discussions and completed the assigned activities, which are documented in the provided link:

[Collaborative Discussion 2 - The Pros and cons of logging â€“ The impact of log4j-Initial post](Module03_Discussion2_Initial.pdf)

[Scanning and Collaborative Wiki Activity](NS_Unit04_WikiActivity.md)

### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I recognize the critical importance of breach analysis and mitigation in maintaining a robust security posture. The knowledge gained from studying typical breaches and evaluating mitigations equips me with the skills to proactively address security risks and respond effectively to potential threats. I did not have time to install a virtual environment and Kali Linux this time, so I did not attend the Wiki activity but studied the information provided by peers in the Wiki.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Moving forward, I will continue to build upon the knowledge and skills acquired in this unit. 
I plan to further explore the possibility of installing [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/import-premade-virtualbox/) to meet potential requirements in upcoming modules, once I am free from the heavy workload of the staggered modules.
