# Unit 3: Vulnerability Assessments

This week we explored the different approaches to vulnerability assessments, ranging from paper-based processes like Cyber Essentials to various vulnerability assessment approaches, including Crest-based and certified Penetration Tests. 
The lecturecast provided insights into a general vulnerability assessment approach that serves as the foundation for more comprehensive penetration tests.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout this unit, we achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - how to assess the unique needs and characteristics of a business and determine the most suitable vulnerability assessment approach.
 - gained practical experience in using open-source tools to perform vulnerability tests and scans.
 - understand the process of identifying and assessing vulnerabilities within a system or network.
 - developed the ability to interpret and analyze the results obtained from vulnerability scans.
 - provide recommendations and strategies to mitigate the identified risks effectively.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I actively participated in collaborative discussions and completed the assigned activities.

### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I recognize the critical importance of vulnerability assessments in ensuring the security and resilience of systems and networks. 
The knowledge gained from this unit has equipped me with the skills to assess and analyze vulnerabilities effectively, enabling me to contribute to the development of robust security measures.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Moving forward, I will continue to build upon the knowledge and practical experience gained in this unit. 
I plan to explore additional resources and tools, participate in practical exercises, and further enhance my proficiency in vulnerability assessments. 
By doing so, I aim to become a competent professional capable of effectively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in diverse environments.
