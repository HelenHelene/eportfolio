# Unit 3: Vulnerability Assessments

This week we explored the different approaches to vulnerability assessments, ranging from paper-based processes like Cyber Essentials to various vulnerability assessment approaches, including Crest-based and certified Penetration Tests. 
The lecturecast provided insights into a general vulnerability assessment approach that serves as the foundation for more comprehensive penetration tests.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout this unit, we achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - how to assess the unique needs and characteristics of a business and determine the most suitable vulnerability assessment approach.
 - gained practical experience in using open-source tools to perform vulnerability tests and scans.
 - understand the process of identifying and assessing vulnerabilities within a system or network.
 - developed the ability to interpret and analyze the results obtained from vulnerability scans.
 - provide recommendations and strategies to mitigate the identified risks effectively.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I actively participated in collaborative discussions and completed the assigned activities.

[Scanning Activity](NS_Unit03_Scanning.md)

### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I recognize the critical importance of vulnerability assessments in ensuring the security and resilience of systems and networks. The scanning activity allowed me to have hands-on practice with scanning and acquire the necessary information for risk assessment. I did not have time to install a virtual environment and Kali Linux this time, so I completed the task in a Windows environment with additional tools.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Moving forward, I will continue to build upon the knowledge and practical experience gained in this unit. Once I am free from the heavy workload of the staggered modules, I will explore the possibility of installing [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to meet potential requirements in upcoming modules.
