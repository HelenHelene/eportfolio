# Unit 6: The Future of the Internet and Generative AI

Unit 6 marks the final week of this module, where we aimed to synthesize the various topics and lessons discussed throughout the module to explore the future of the internet. 
The key question we sought to answer was: What is the future of the internet? In addressing this question, we considered technical and security considerations, as well as social, legal, and privacy challenges. 
Additionally, we engaged in debates surrounding generative AI and its impact on network security.

### Learning Outcomes
During this unit, we achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - reviewed technological advances that aim to address the current shortcomings of the internet. 
 - gained an understanding of how these solutions envision the future of the internet, including their operational mechanisms and architectural changes.
 - delved into the various solutions proposed for the next-generation internet and analyzed how they tackle key challenges such as technical limitations, security concerns, societal implications, legal frameworks, and privacy considerations.
 - explored the potential benefits of leveraging generative AI for network security purposes, as well as the associated risks and challenges.
