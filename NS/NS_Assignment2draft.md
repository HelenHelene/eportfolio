## Summary of Work Carried Out

The audit involved a comprehensive review of G&J's website, utilizing both automated and manual testing methods. Tools such as Burp Suite, NSlookup, and manual testing procedures were employed to uncover vulnerabilities across various aspects of the website. The assessment included exploring potential security risks, non-compliance with regulatory standards, and overall website security posture.
