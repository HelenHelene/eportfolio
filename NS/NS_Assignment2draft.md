# Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Results and Executive Summary for Gin & Juice Shop (1,200 words)

## Introduction

This document synthesizes the results of a comprehensive vulnerability audit and assessment conducted on the Gin & Juice Shop website (https://ginandjuice.shop/). The analysis focused on identifying security vulnerabilities and non-compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). The assessment was carried out using a combination of automated tools, including Burp Suite, and manual testing techniques to ensure a thorough evaluation.

## Summary of Work Carried Out

The vulnerability assessment encompassed the following key activities:

- **Automated Scanning**: Utilizing Burp Suite to identify potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web application issues.
- **Manual Testing**: Conducting targeted tests to validate findings from automated scans and to explore additional areas such as accessibility and compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS standards.
- **Data Analysis**: Reviewing and categorizing vulnerabilities based on severity and confidence levels, followed by mapping these against relevant security standards.

## Summary Findings

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **SQL Injection**
   - **Instances**: `/catalog/filter`, `/catalog/product/stock`, `/catalog/product/stock`
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential full control over the database.
   - **Evidence**: The category parameter and session cookie were found to be injectable, leading to different query responses indicating SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection**
   - **Instance**: `/catalog/product/stock`
   - **Impact**: Potential access to internal files and network services.
   - **Evidence**: Server interaction with an external domain through the injected entity.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Instances**: Multiple endpoints including `/catalog/search/2` and `/catalog/search/3`
   - **Impact**: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript, leading to session hijacking and data theft.
   - **Evidence**: Reflected user input in HTML and JavaScript contexts without proper sanitization.

4. **External Service Interaction (HTTP and DNS)**
   - **Instances**: Multiple endpoints including `/catalog/product` and `/catalog/product/stock`
   - **Impact**: Potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
   - **Evidence**: Server performed HTTP and DNS lookups to arbitrary domains.

### Medium and Low Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **Client-Side Template Injection**
   - **Instance**: `/catalog/search/4`
   - **Impact**: Potential for DOM-based XSS.
   - **Evidence**: Injection of AngularJS expressions leading to untrusted execution contexts.

2. **Vulnerable JavaScript Dependency**
   - **Instance**: Usage of AngularJS version 1.7.7
   - **Impact**: Known vulnerabilities including XSS.
   - **Evidence**: Identified through the library version used in the application.

3. **Password Field with Autocomplete Enabled**
   - **Instance**: `/login`
   - **Impact**: Increased risk of credential theft.
   - **Evidence**: Password field with autocomplete attribute enabled.

4. **Strict Transport Security Not Enforced**
   - **Instance**: Multiple paths.
   - **Impact**: Vulnerability to SSL stripping attacks.
   - **Evidence**: Absence of `Strict-Transport-Security` header.

## Evaluation Against Security Standards
### GDPR ComplianceThe Gin & Juice Shop website demonstrates several areas of non-compliance with GDPR requirements:
1. **Data Security Measures**: The presence of SQL injection and XXE vulnerabilities indicates inadequate protection of personal data.
2. **Consent Mechanisms**: No explicit mechanism for obtaining user consent before processing their data was observed.
3. **Documentation of Data Processing Activities**: Lack of visible documentation regarding data processing activities.
4. **User Rights Mechanisms**: No clear mechanism for users to exercise their rights under GDPR.
   
### PCI DSS ComplianceThe website also exhibits non-compliance with PCI DSS standards:
1. **Protecting Cardholder Data**: Vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS pose significant risks to cardholder data.
2. **Data Encryption**: Lack of strict transport security enforcement indicates potential gaps in data encryption during transmission.
3. **Security Controls**: Insufficient implementation of security controls to prevent unauthorized data access.

## Conclusions
The vulnerability audit of the Gin & Juice Shop website reveals critical security issues that could severely impact the business and its customers. The identified vulnerabilities, especially those of high severity, demand immediate attention to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS standards.

## Recommendations
### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**   - **Justification**: Prevent unauthorized access to the database and potential data breaches.   - **Action**: Implement parameterized queries and prepared statements across all database interactions.
2. **Implement XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Mitigations**   - **Justification**: Protect against unauthorized access to internal files and services.   - **Action**: Configure XML parsers to disable external entity processing.
3. **Mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**   - **Justification**: Prevent session hijacking and data theft.   - **Action**: Apply rigorous input validation and output encoding.

### High Priority
1. **Secure External Service Interactions**   - **Justification**: Prevent SSRF attacks and misuse of the server as an attack proxy.   - **Action**: Implement whitelisting of permitted services and hosts.
2. **Update Vulnerable JavaScript Dependencies**   - **Justification**: Eliminate known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.   - **Action**: Upgrade AngularJS to a version with no known security issues.

### Medium Priority
1. **Disable Autocomplete for Sensitive Fields**   - **Justification**: Reduce the risk of credential theft.   - **Action**: Add `autocomplete="off"` to password input fields.
2. **Enforce Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**   - **Justification**: Prevent SSL stripping attacks.   - **Action**: Add the `Strict-Transport-Security` header with appropriate directives.

### Low Priority
1. **Set Secure and HttpOnly Flags on Cookies**   - **Justification**: Enhance cookie security against interception and client-side script access.   - **Action**: Configure cookies to include the Secure and HttpOnly attributes.
2. **Implement Clickjacking Protection**   - **Justification**: Prevent unauthorized actions via clickjacking.   - **Action**: Add the `X-Frame-Options` header with the value `DENY`.By addressing these recommendations, the Gin & Juice Shop can significantly improve its security posture, ensuring the protection of customer data and compliance with essential security standards.
