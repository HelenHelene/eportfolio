# Unit 1: History of Network Security, Vulnerabilities and Approaches

During this unit, I had the opportunity to delve into the history of network security and vulnerabilities, and I was able to connect it to the current landscape. 
Additionally, I explored various security best practices and studied the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al., 2011), which provided valuable insights into contemporary breach approaches.


### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:
 - gained a deep understanding of the origins of common attacks. Learning about the historical context of these attacks helped me appreciate the evolution of network security and the importance of staying updated with the latest defense mechanisms.
 - equipped to recommend a best practice approach to mitigate attacks. This involves implementing robust security measures, conducting regular vulnerability assessments, and adopting proactive strategies to safeguard networks and systems.
 - explored various modern protection techniques that are being employed to combat evolving cyber threats. Understanding these techniques will enable me to make informed decisions regarding the implementation of appropriate security measures.
