# Unit 4: Security Standards, Frameworks and Disaster Recovery

Welcome to Week 4 where we will look at another crucial aspect of Security and Risk Management – industry and enterprise security standards. This module will discuss the role of standards in risk assessments and security designs and will also discuss some of the implications of standards for business continuity and disaster recovery.

This week we shall:
 - Explore industry specific security standards and directives.
 - Discuss how standards affect security and risk assessments.
 - Review approaches to disaster recovery and DR as a Service (DRaaS).

On completion of this week, you will be able to:
 - List common security standards and select the appropriate one(s) for a given situation.
 - Describe how to design and create DR solutions.
This unit describes the key roles that risk assessment, management and security standards play in security management and DR planning.

### Artefacts 
As part of my e-portfolio, I completed the assigned activities which are documented in the provided link:

[Collaborative Wiki Development - Security Frameworks](ISM_Unit04_Wiki.md)

[Disaster Recovery (DR) Solutions Design and Review](ISM_Unit04_Seminar.md)

[Optional Activity - GDPR Case Studies](ISM_Unit04_GDPR.md)

### Reflections
Unit 4 was an enriching experience that deepened my understanding of security standards, frameworks, and disaster recovery solutions. As a Data Protection Officer (DPO) with a PECB ISO/IEC 27001 Foundation certification, this unit was particularly relevant to my role and responsibilities. Throughout this unit, I engaged with various activities that highlighted the importance of industry-specific security standards, the role of risk assessments in security designs, and effective disaster recovery strategies.

Firstly, exploring industry-specific security standards was particularly insightful. I delved into various IT security frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, COBIT, HITRUST CSF, and GDPR. Understanding these frameworks helped me appreciate their specific applications and benefits. For instance, ISO 27001 provides a comprehensive set of controls for establishing an information security management system (ISMS), while NIST SP 800-53 is renowned for its rigorous standards to manage and mitigate security risks. Engaging in the Collaborative Wiki Development activity enabled me to analyze and recommend suitable security frameworks for different organizational contexts, such as international banks, large hospitals, and food manufacturing factories. This practical exercise taught me how to select appropriate standards based on industry needs and regulatory requirements.

Moreover, the unit emphasized the impact of standards on risk assessments. I learned that compliance with IT security frameworks ensures robust security measures, protects sensitive data, meets regulatory requirements, and reduces the risk of security breaches. The Disaster Recovery (DR) Solutions Design and Review exercise underscored the importance of balancing Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) with business needs and resources. Understanding the differences between hot, warm, and cold standby solutions and their implications on availability, RPO, and RTO was particularly enlightening. This knowledge is crucial for designing effective and cost-efficient disaster recovery solutions.

Additionally, the focus on disaster recovery and DR as a Service (DRaaS) was highly beneficial. Through case studies and design exercises, I learned how to create and evaluate DR solutions, considering factors such as high availability, data replication, and failover mechanisms. Analyzing vendor lock-in issues and how to mitigate them was an essential part of the learning process, as these issues can significantly impact the resilience of DR solutions. The GDPR-related case studies, such as the disclosure of CCTV footage, highlighted the importance of data protection, compliance with access requests, and implementing robust security measures. This case underscored the severe consequences of inadequate data protection practices and emphasized the need for clear contracts, comprehensive policies, regular training, and rigorous security protocols.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
To build on the knowledge and skills acquired in Unit 4, I plan to undertake several actions that align with my role as a Data Protection Officer and my interest in GDPR compliance and frameworks.

Firstly, I will continue to enhance my expertise by pursuing advanced certifications related to GDPR and data protection frameworks. This includes certifications such as the Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP/E) and additional ISO/IEC 27001 qualifications. Staying current with evolving IT security frameworks and disaster recovery practices by participating in relevant webinars, workshops, and industry conferences will also be a priority.

In terms of practical application, I will implement and regularly review data protection policies and disaster recovery plans in my organization to ensure they align with the latest standards and best practices. Conducting regular risk assessments and security audits will help identify vulnerabilities and enhance our security posture. Furthermore, I aim to foster a culture of security awareness by organizing regular training sessions for employees on data protection policies, disaster recovery procedures, and compliance with security standards. Collaboration with cross-functional teams will ensure that security measures and disaster recovery plans are integrated into all aspects of the organization’s operations.

Maintaining comprehensive documentation of all data processing activities, security measures, and disaster recovery plans will demonstrate compliance with GDPR and other relevant regulations. Developing and testing incident response plans are also crucial to ensure prompt and effective handling of data breaches and other security incidents.
