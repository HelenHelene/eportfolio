# Module 4 Information Security Management

This module covers the integration of security and risk within enterprise solutions, highlighting their overlap and interaction. It explores qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, traditional and hybrid risk models, common security standards like PCI-DSS, and business continuity and disaster recovery solutions. Additionally, the module delves into key research topics and advances in security and risk management.

Throughout this module, we learn to differentiate between qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, conduct qualitative assessments, and create and interpret threat models. By the end of the module, we will be able to identify, analyze, and manage security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in information systems using appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques. We will also systematically analyze security breaches using multiple information sources and critically appraise security management tools and techniques. Moreover, we will articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by information security professionals.

The module includes three assignments. The first assignment requires us to conduct risk assessments for a business's current state and potential digitalization and to recommend a course of action based on these assessments. The second assignment involves developing a Python application to visualize and evaluate attack trees, demonstrating threat models before and after digitalization. The final assignment is an individual reflection on our personal development throughout the module.
