# Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management

In Unit 3, we explored various approaches to threat modelling, including STRIDE, DREAD, Attack Trees, and hybrid models like the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA). We also discussed the differences between threats and vulnerabilities and reviewed several guides and cookbooks to aid in selecting appropriate threat modelling frameworks.

### Learning Outcomes
This unit was essential in introducing the differences between threats and vulnerabilities and presenting various threat modelling and management tools.  By the end of this unit, I achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - Technique Description: I can describe multiple threat modelling techniques.
 - Technique Selection: I can advise on which technique should be used in specific situations.
 - Hybrid Models: I understand when techniques should be combined into a hybrid model.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I completed the assigned exercise.

### Reflections
This weekâ€™s focus on threat modelling approaches and security standards significantly enhanced my understanding of how to assess and manage risks effectively. The research on the GDPR, PCI Security Standards, and HIPAA provided a solid foundation for understanding the regulatory requirements and their implications for digital security. Applying GDPR and PCI SS to Assignment 1 helped me grasp the practical aspects of conducting a risk assessment for Pampered Pets' digitalization.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
After understanding different threat modelling approaches, I have determined that OCTAVE-S is the most suitable for Assignment 1. Therefore, I will focus on researching OCTAVE-S extensively.
