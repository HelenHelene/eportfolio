# Unit 2 Seminar – Threat Modelling Exercises

Attempt all 3 activities before attending this week’s seminar.

Read Shostack (2018), chapters 3 – 5, which cover STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees and Attack libraries. 
Read Spring et al (2021), which discusses the history and some failings with CVSS. 
Then create a threat model based on one of the following scenarios:
1. A large international airport based in the United States of America.
2. A large international bank based in the UK.
3. A large nuclear power station in France.

You should use the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook and the ATT&CK libraries to inform your model design. 
Be prepared to share and discuss your designs at the seminar session this week.
