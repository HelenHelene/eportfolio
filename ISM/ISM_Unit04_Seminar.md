# Unit 4 Seminar – DR Solutions Design and Review

Attempt all 3 activities before attending this week’s seminar.

### Activity 1: DR Terms and Concepts
Read Alhazmi & Malaiya (2013) and then answer the following questions:
1. What is the difference between Hot Standby, Warm Standby and Cold Standby? Frame your answers in terms of availability, RPO and RTO.
2. Does the technology deployed affect the options available? For example, can you create a high availability, hot standby solution between two on-premise data centres?

Justify and support your answers with appropriate references from academic journals and sources. Add you answers to your e-portfolio and be prepared to share them in this week’s seminar.

### Activity 2: DR Solutions Design
Read Opara-Martins et al (2014) and Morrow et al (2021) and answer the following questions:
1. What are some of the main vendor lock-in issues the authors identify? How would you mitigate them?
2. What are some of the security concerns with the modern cloud? How can these be mitigated?

### Activity 3: DR Solutions Design and Review
Create a high-level diagram of a DR solution for each of the following requirements. They should be created in PowerPoint, and you should include a basic description of each design.
1. RPO= 1 hr; RTO= 8 hrs; high availability (HA) required.
2. RPO= 24 hrs; RTO = 72 hrs; HA NOT required.
3. RPO= 5 mins; RTO= 1 hr; HA required.
   
Add your answers to your e-portfolio and be prepared to discuss them during the seminar this week.

### Learning Outcomes
Identify and analyse security risks, threats and vulnerabilities in information systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts & warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches & issues.
Critically appraise and utilise methodologies, tools and techniques that help manage and audit security issues
