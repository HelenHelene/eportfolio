# Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management

During this unit, we focused on the basics of Security and Risk Management. We learned different definitions of risk, how to manage risks, and the processes involved in assessing and mitigating them. 
This unit introduced both qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, which we will explore further in future weeks.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:
 - Understood various definitions of risk.
 - Learned how to assess, qualify, and mitigate risks.
 - Explored different methods to quantify and qualify risks.
 - Identified common security and risk standards and chose the right ones for specific situations.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I read [Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019)](ISM_Unit01_Reading.pdf) as the basis of the case study and participated in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - The Risks of Digitalisation-Initial post](ISM_Unit01_Discussion.pdf)

### Reflections
This unit provided a solid introduction to Security and Risk Management. Learning about different definitions and concepts of risk helped me understand the complexity of managing risks. The structured approach to the risk management process was particularly useful. 
Participating in discussions allowed me to apply what I learned to practical scenarios. Specifically, the request to provide two real-world examples in the Initial post was a great way to see real-world applications of risk management strategies.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Moving forward, I will continue reading more about risk management and look for opportunities to apply risk management concepts in real situations.
