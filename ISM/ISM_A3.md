### [Assignment 3: Individual Reflective Piece](ISM_A3_Reflection.pdf)

<br>

#### Introduction
This reflection discusses my experiences and learning outcomes from the Information Security Management (ISM) module in my MSc in Computer Science. The module enhanced my technical proficiency and contributed to professional and personal growth. As a Data Protection Officer (DPO) interested in GDPR compliance, the knowledge gained has immense practical value.

#### Summary of Learning Outcomes
The ISM module explored information security management's legal, social, ethical, and professional dimensions. We learned techniques for threat modeling, risk assessment, and mitigation. The two main assignments, Risk Identification Report and developing  Python application for Attack Tree Visualization, applied theoretical concepts practically.

#### Assignment 1: Risk Identification Report
The first assignment involved conducting comprehensive [risk assessment for Pampered Pets](ISM_A1.md), considering both pre- and post-digitalization threats. Using the OCTAVE-S method, I honed my skills in identifying and evaluating potential risks, gaining insights into mitigating these risks. This assignment deepened my understanding of critical assets, threat profiles, and strategies for safeguarding organizational data.

#### Assignment 2: Attack Tree Visualization Application 
The second assignment required developing [Python application to visualize and evaluate attack trees](ISM_A2.md). With no prior experience in Python visualization tools, I researched libraries like PyVis, NetworkX, and Tkinter. Unlike the previous module, this one did not provide Codio training and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for our coding assignment. Therefore, I self-learned and utilized Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which I intend to continue using. This assignment pushed me beyond the provided learning resources, refining my programming abilities and equipping me with the skills to present complex security concepts clearly.

#### Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management 
Unit 1 provided a foundation in security and risk management basics. We discussed various definitions and concepts of risk, enhancing my understanding of the complexities involved. Real-world discussions, like those on data privacy and security risks at UnitedHealth Group and Boeing 737 MAX, highlighted the importance of effective risk management. [Collaborative Discussion](ISM_Unit01_Disscussion.pdf).

#### Unit 2: Threat Modelling Exercises
In Unit 2, we focused on threat modeling and management. I selected large international bank for [Threat Modeling Exercises](ISM_Unit02_Seminar.md), improving my understanding of tools like STRIDE, DREAD, OWASP, and the ATT&CK framework. Applying these tools in realistic scenarios helped me grasp their practical applications.

#### Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management
[Security Standards Exercise](ISM_Unit03_Exercise.md) where we researched regulations like GDPR, PCI Security Standards, and HIPAA. We applied this knowledge to Pampered Pets, building my understanding of how regulations impact digital security.

#### Unit 4: Security Standards, Frameworks, and Disaster Recovery
As a DPO with PECB ISO/IEC 27001 Foundation certification , this unit was my favorite and particularly relevant. [Collaborative Wiki](ISM_Unit04_Wiki.md) taught me how to choose the right framework based on an organization’s needs and regulations. [GDPR CCTV case studies](ISM_Unit04_GDPR.md) directly related to my job, aiding in creating a Data Protection Policy for CCTV monitoring. The [Disaster Recovery Solutions Design and Review activity](ISM_Unit04_Seminar.md)) was timely, coinciding with discussions on system downtime tolerance with our headquarters IT department.

#### Unit 5 and 6: Future Trends in ISM
The final units focused on future trends in information security management, including AI and automation. [Collaborative Wiki](ISM_Unit05_Wiki.md) and debates on impactful trends highlighted the evolving landscape of ISM.

#### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan (PDP)
This module significantly improved my professional skills. I am now better at threat modeling, writing assessment reports, and understanding GDPR, essential for my role as DPO. Clear communication of risk assessments has enhanced interactions between management and IT teams.
