### [Assignment 3: Individual Reflection](Module03_BaselineAnalysisAndPlan.pdf)

<br>

#### Introduction
Submit by end of unit 6. This assignment counts for 30% of the total module mark. The word count for this reflection is 800 words (not including diagrams, charts and illustrations). This also applies to your transcript, if applicable.

#### Assignment Details
It is expected that reflections will be written as you progress through the module, as listed above. 
The final reflective piece that you prepare, which might include components of the reflections that you have captured throughout the module is the piece which should be capped at the given word limit.

In writing the reflective content, some people find a diary-style approach helps. 
You can use this [Reflection Toolkit from the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience) to get further guidance on reflection. For example, you can use Rolfe et al.’s (2001) approach. 
You could start by providing a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incident (WHAT), analyse and interpret the information (SO WHAT) and then decide how you can use the information and learning from it (NOW WHAT). 
You can find out more about the structure of your reflection below. 
Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through.

#### Reflective Piece (This covers all learning outcomes, as well as the module aims).
This should include the following, as part of professional development aspect of the module:
 - Summary of learning outcomes.
 - Feedback from peers and tutors.
 - Professional Skills matrix and action plan (PDP).

Other artefacts developed during the module should be included, such as from formative tasks. You will need to describe/show how those artefacts relate to the module learning outcomes.

Skills to be gained here are:
 - Time management.
 - Critical thinking and analysis.
 - Communication and Literacy skills.
 - IT and Digital.
 - Numeracy.
 - Research.
 - Interpersonal.
 - Problem-solving.
 - Ethical Awareness
   
These are some exploratory questions from the grading criteria to help you develop your reflection:
 - Have you clearly described the topic of your assignment and the various aspects of the learning outcomes which are key to your reflection? (Knowledge and understanding weighted at 20%)
 - Emotional Response and Analysis. Critically analyse yourself and your own behaviour during the application of the module learning outcomes. How did this make you feel? How did these emotions affect you and your work? Have you reviewed the views of others where relevant, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done? (Application of Knowledge weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 10%)
 - Learning and Changed Actions. Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this module. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 10%)
 - Do you have evidence of skills and knowledge developed through this module? Provide a clear description of your evidence of learning during this module and how you can apply (or have applied) them in a real-world experience. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 5%, Criticality weighted at 5%)
 - You will need to evidence and evaluate your individual contribution, completing tasks to the required standard. You will also need to demonstrate clear participation in the team activities where relevant, as it informs your reflection. Legible screenshots are acceptable and will not affect your word count. (Collaboration weighted at 25%)
 - Is there an accurate use of citations and references throughout this piece of work? Have you demonstrated the required integrity in your submission? (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%)

The emphasis here is not on the look and feel of your reflection. The content of your reflection must be well organised, communicating your thoughts in a clear and concise manner, taking into account any requirements from the assessment guidance. Your work should have minimal errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation. (Structure and Presentation weighted at 5%)
