### [Assignment 3: Individual Reflective Piece](ISM_A3_Reflection.pdf)

<br>

#### Introduction
Reflecting on my journey through the Information Security Management (ISM) module of my MSc in Computer Science, I feel both challenged and enriched. This module has not only improved my technical skills but also significantly impacted my professional and personal development. As a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is deeply interested in GDPR compliance and frameworks, the knowledge gained from this module is invaluable to me.

#### Summary of Learning Outcomes
Throughout this module, I explored various aspects of information security management, including legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by information security and risk professionals. The module covered techniques for scanning, evaluating, and mitigating network vulnerabilities, providing a solid understanding of vulnerability assessment basics, especially in web applications. Key assignments included conducting a risk assessment and developing a Python application to visualize and evaluate attack trees.

#### Assignment 1: Risk Identification Report
The first assignment required a comprehensive risk assessment for Pampered Pets, evaluating both pre-digitalization and post-digitalization threats. This assignment taught me how to analyze network vulnerabilities in detail and develop a comprehensive plan for assessment. I utilized the OCTAVE-S method, which is tailored for small organizations, to identify and mitigate risks effectively. The assignment also provided me with a deeper understanding of the critical assets, threat profiles, and mitigation strategies necessary to protect an organization’s data during a digital transformation.

#### Assignment 2: Attack Tree Visualization Application
The second assignment involved developing a Python application to visualize and evaluate attack trees. This assignment was particularly challenging as I had no prior experience with Python visualization tools. I conducted extensive research to familiarize myself with various packages and libraries, including PyVis, NetworkX, and Tkinter. I also learned to use Visual Studio Code, a user-friendly IDE that I plan to continue using throughout my MSc journey. Creating the attack tree visualization not only honed my programming skills but also enhanced my ability to present complex security concepts in an easily understandable format.

#### Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management
This unit provided a solid introduction to security and risk management. Learning about different definitions and concepts of risk helped me understand the complexity of managing risks. The structured approach to the risk management process was particularly useful, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

#### Unit 2: Threat Modelling Exercises
In Unit 2, we delved into the risk management process (RMP) and engaged in threat modelling and management activities. This unit was pivotal as it introduced me to threat modelling, a fundamental skill for both cybersecurity and development teams. The collaborative discussions and exercises significantly enhanced my understanding of threat modelling tools and their applications.

#### Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management
This unit focused on various approaches to threat modelling, including STRIDE, DREAD, and attack trees. It significantly enhanced my understanding of how to assess and manage risks effectively. The research on GDPR, PCI Security Standards, and HIPAA provided a solid foundation for understanding regulatory requirements and their implications for digital security.

#### Unit 4: Security Standards, Frameworks, and Disaster Recovery
As a DPO with a PECB ISO/IEC 27001 Foundation certification, this unit is my favorite one which was particularly relevant to my role. It emphasized the importance of industry-specific security standards, risk assessments in security designs, and effective disaster recovery strategies. The collaborative Wiki activities highlighted the practical aspects of implementing security frameworks to different organizations like an international bank, a large hospital, and a large food manufacturing factory, teaching me how to choose the right framework based on industry needs and regulations. The GDPR case studies, particularly the CCTV case, are directly applicable to my job role as I am currently establishing a Data Protection Policy for CCTV monitoring for my company. Coincidentally, I am currently reviewing the emergency plan for IT infrastructure and discussing the maximum tolerable system downtime of my company. The knowledge I gained from the activity Disaster Recovery (DR) Solutions Design and Review provided me with the necessary insights to go deeper into this topic with our head of IT department of headquarters.

#### Unit 5: Future Trends in Security and Risk Management
This unit reviewed current and emerging trends in security and risk management. It provided insights into the impact of trends such as AI and automation on the future of information security. The collaborative wiki development and debates on the most influential trends were particularly enriching.

#### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan (PDP)
The knowledge and skills developed during this module, such as conducting network vulnerability assessments, drafting assessment reports, and understanding GDPR and WCAG compliance, are invaluable. Specifically, GDPR compliance is directly transferable to real-world scenarios in my current role as a DPO. The ability to issue an assessment report makes it easier to communicate between top management and information technology teams.
