# Unit 2: Threat Modelling Exercises

In Unit 2, we delved into the Risk Management Process (RMP), focusing on the impact of different assessment methods—Qualitative vs. Quantitative. We engaged in threat modelling and management activities, guided by essential resources such as the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Cookbook, and the Mitre ATT&CK database.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I achieved the following learning outcomes:

 - Resource Identification: I can now locate key tools and resources for threat modelling with confidence.
 - Tool Selection: I learned how to choose the most suitable tool for various threat modelling situations.
 - Critical Evaluation: I developed the ability to critically assess the effectiveness of different threat modelling tools.

This unit was pivotal as it introduced me to threat modelling, a fundamental skill for both cybersecurity and development teams.


### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
During this unit, I continued the collaborative discussions as recorded below:

Collaborative Discussion 1 - The Risks of Digitalisation-Initial post-Respond to peers: [Respond1](ISM_Unit02_Respond1.pdf) & [Respond2](ISM_Unit02_Respond2.pdf)

### Reflections
This week’s reading comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in threat modelling and risk management.  The OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook provided practical insights and actionable steps, which I found particularly useful in applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.  The collaborative discussions were particularly enriching, as they provided diverse viewpoints and fostered a deeper collective understanding of the challenges in Industry 4.0.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
To deepen my understanding of different threat modelling approaches and determine which can be applied to Assignment 1, I will focus on researching OCTAVE extensively as a preliminary assessment. Additionally, I will conduct research on relevant security standards to prepare for the upcoming assignment.
