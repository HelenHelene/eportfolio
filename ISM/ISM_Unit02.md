# Unit 2: Threat Modelling Exercises

Welcome to Week 2 where we will conduct a deeper dive into the Risk Management Process – specifically looking at the effect of different types of assessment (Qualitative vs. Quantitative) and we will practice threat modelling and management, guided by the threat modelling manifesto, the OWASP cookbook and the Mitre ATT&CK database.

This week we shall:
Review the Risk Management Process (RMP).
Review the effects of different assessment types (Qualitative vs. Quantitative).
Discuss various tools and resources that can be used in threat modelling and management.
Evaluate the use of publicly available tools to assist with Threat Modelling.
Create threat models based on suggested scenarios.

On completion of this week, you will be able to:
Describe where to find the key tools and resources used for threat modelling.
Explain how to select the most appropriate tool for various situations.
Critically evaluate the use of such tools.
This is a key unit in the module because it introduces students to the topic of threat modelling which is a core competency both for cyber security and development teams.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I read Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) as the basis of the case study and participated in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:
