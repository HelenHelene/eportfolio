# Collaborative Wiki Development - Security Frameworks

Read the article by [Barafort et al (2018](ISM_Unit04_Reading.pdf) and the blog by [Kirvan (2023)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/IT-security-frameworks-and-standards-Choosing-the-right-one?vgnextfmt=print%20%5bAccessed%201%20July%202022%5d). Review the websites listed in the blog and then answer the following questions.

Q1. Which of the frameworks do you think would be applicable to the following organisations:
 - International bank.
 - Large hospital.
 - Large food manufacturing factory.

Q2. Summarise the tests and recommendations you would make to the owners/ managers for each of the above businesses to help them use the frameworks and comply with industry standards.
Your responses should be posted into the Wiki available in Module Resources. Be careful not to delete any other entries when editing the wiki.
The wiki for this activity should consist of two sections:
 - The first section should be a FAQ (frequently asked questions) where you can post questions. In addition, if you have encountered and solved any of the questions/ issues, you should post your responses to the queries.
 - The second section involves the responses to the questions above- each of you should post a compilation of your responses in the wiki. Doing so will allow your fellow students to evaluate the recommendations made and also ask questions (in the FAQ) about why certain answers/ decisions were made. Your individual postings should be collated as part of your e-portfolio.

As the module carries on, consider what you have now learned and respond to at least two of your peers’ contributions in the Wiki. You may find you can answer their questions or provide additional information or clarification, or simply compare their results with your own.

### Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and analyse security risks, threats and vulnerabilities in information systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
 - Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts & warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches & issues.
 - Critically appraise and utilise methodologies, tools and techniques that help manage and audit security issues.
