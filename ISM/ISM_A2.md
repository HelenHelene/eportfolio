<br>

ðŸ”—[Attack Tree Visualization Application - Python Scripts](attack_tree\index.md)

<br>

#### Overview
This application was developed to analyze the risks associated with Pampered Pets, a business considering digital transformation. The goal was to evaluate both the current operational risks (Pre-digitalisation) and the potential risks introduced by digitalisation (Post-digitalisation).

This Python application visualizes an attack tree based on a JSON input specification. The attack tree represents potential threats to a system, and users can assign values (monetary amounts or probabilities) to the leaf nodes. The application aggregates these values to determine the overall impact of identified threats. It uses the PyVis library to create an interactive graphical representation of the attack tree. The application is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, leveraging Python libraries to handle graph structures and visualizations. Users can easily input data and receive meaningful visual and numerical outputs.

Below Figure 1 illustrates the threats assessed by the OCTAVE-S method in the previous Risk Identification Report.

#### Key Features
1.	Interactive Visualization: The PyVis library enables an interactive attack tree visualization, making it easy to explore node relationships and values. Users can zoom, pan, and click on nodes for detailed information (Pyvis, N.D.).
2.	User Input Handling: The application uses Tkinter for user input, ensuring a smooth and intuitive data entry process. This allows users to assign values to leaf nodes easily, without needing to modify the JSON directly (Acsany, 2024; Boff Nunes, 2024; Python, N.D.a).
3.	Value Aggregation: The application accurately sums the values provided by the user to reflect the overall threat assessment. This offers a clear and concise overview of the total risk associated with the system.

#### Execution Instructions
1.	Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your IDE.
2.	Ensure the required Python libraries (networkx, pyvis, json, tkinter) are installed. If not, install the packages using pip.
3.	Save the provided Python code in a file named attack_tree.py.
4.	Save the provided JSON files as pre_digitalisation.json and post_digitalisation.json in the same directory as your Python script.
5.	Execute the attack_tree.py script.

6.	The application will open a series of dialogs asking for input values for each leaf node.  Enter the values as prompted.
   
     <img src="ISM_A2_Input.jpg" alt="Input" width="300"/>

7.	After entering all values, the script will display the total aggregated value and create HTML files for visualizing the attack trees:

     <img src="ISM_A2_Output2.jpg" alt="Visualization" width="400"/>
â€ƒ
8.	The HTML files will be saved in the same directory where you run the Python script. Ensure you know the path to this directory.

9.	Open the HTML files in a web browser to view the attack tree before and after user inputs.

#### Input
1.	**JSON files:** The application accepts an attack tree specification in JSON format. The JSON structure should define the hierarchy of nodes and their relationships (Figure 2 and Figure 3).

    Figure 3: JSON input specification of Post-digitalisation 	 

    <img src="ISM_A2_Json2.jpg" alt="Json file" width="300"/>

2.	**User Input:** During execution, the application will prompt the user to enter values (monetary amounts or probabilities) for each leaf node. User can measure an organizationâ€™s loss from a single threat using the Single Loss Exposure (SLE) formula:

        SLE = AV Ã— EF
  	
    Asset Value (AV) is a synthetic measure of the cost of creating, developing, supporting, replacing, and owning an asset.  Exposure Factor (EF) is a measure of the magnitude of loss or impact on the value of an asset from a threat event, expressed as a percentage of the asset value (Bistarelli et al., 2011).
  
    Due to limitations in the financial information of Pampered Pets, the demonstration provided is just a sample figure and does not consider SLE.

#### Output
The application produces two sets of HTML files:
1.	Visualizes the initial attack tree with default values â€“ zero (Figure 4 and Figure 5).
2.	Visualizes the final attack tree with user-provided values and aggregated results (Figure 6 and Figure 7).

#### Dependencies and libraries

| **Import** |	**Description** |
| :--------- | :-------------- |
| json |	A module for parsing JSON data, used to load attack tree structures from JSON files. The attack tree is specified in JSON format (Acsany, 2024; Boff Nunes, 2024; Python, N.D.a). |
| networkx |	A library for creating and manipulating complex networks, used to create and manage the attack tree graph (NetworkX, N.D.). |
| pyvis.network	| A module from the PyVis library that enables the creation of interactive network visualizations in a web browser (Pyvis, N.D.). |
