# Optional Activity â€“ GDPR Case Studies

This exercise is to choose a case study from the [Data Protection Commission (2020)](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies) concerning GDPR-related issues and breaches and answer the questions below.

### Summary of the 2018 Case Study 5: Disclosure of CCTV footage from a direct provision centre.
A complaint was filed by solicitors on behalf of a resident of a direct provision accommodation centre about the alleged unauthorized disclosure of CCTV footage capturing the complainant's images. The centre is state-owned, managed by Aramark Ireland on behalf of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA). The disclosure came to light during a radio program where the host claimed to have the footage, which showed an altercation involving the complainant.

The complainant made complaints to RIA, Aramark, and the radio station. An access request was sent to RIA for details of all recipients of the disclosed data. However, RIA did not respond within the required 40-day period.

The Data Protection Commission (DPC) investigated and found that:
 - **No Written Contract:** There was no written contract between RIA and Aramark delineating their data processing responsibilities, breaching Section 2C(3) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.
 - **Security Failures:** Both RIA and Aramark failed to ensure appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure, violating Section 2(1)(d).
 - **Non-Compliance with Access Request:** RIA failed to respond to the access request within the prescribed timeframe, contravening their obligations under the Data Protection Acts.
   
Despite thorough forensic IT investigations, neither RIA nor Aramark could definitively confirm that the footage had not been disclosed to the radio station. The DPC concluded that the complainant's rights were infringed due to inadequate data protection measures and lack of clear, documented policies and procedures. This case underscores the significant consequences of non-compliance with data protection obligations.

### What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?
 - **Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs):** This aspect pertains to the requirement under GDPR for data controllers to respond to access requests from data subjects within prescribed timeframes. In this case, the RIA failed to respond to an access request within the 40-day timeframe as mandated by the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.
 - **Data Processing Agreements:** The case highlights the necessity for written contracts between data controllers and data processors, delineating their respective responsibilities, as required by Article 28 of the GDPR. The absence of a clear, documented agreement between the RIA and Aramark constituted a significant breach.
 - **Security of Processing:** Under Article 32 of the GDPR, both data controllers and processors are required to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The failure to have adequate policies and procedures for managing CCTV footage led to unauthorized disclosure, breaching this provision.
 - **Accountability:** The GDPR mandates that data controllers must be able to demonstrate compliance with data protection principles (Article 5(2)). The lack of oversight and proper documentation in this case illustrates a failure in maintaining accountability.
 
### How was it resolved?
The resolution of the case involved the following key findings and decisions by the Data Protection Commission (DPC):
 - **Non-Compliance with Access Request:** The DPC found that the RIA did not respond to the access request within the prescribed timeframe, contravening Section 4 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.
 - **Lack of Written Contracts:** The DPC identified that there was no written contract delineating the responsibilities of the RIA and Aramark regarding data processing activities. This was a breach of Section 2C(3) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.
 - **Inadequate Security Measures:** Both the RIA and Aramark failed to ensure appropriate security measures against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, violating Section 2(1)(d) of the same Acts.
 - **Failure to Ensure Compliance:** The DPC concluded that there was a failure to ensure employees and other personnel were aware of and complied with security measures, as required by Section 2C(2).

The DPC's decision underscored the importance of having clear, documented policies and procedures for data processing activities, as well as formal agreements between data controllers and processors.

### If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?
As an Information Security Manager, the following steps would be critical to mitigate such issues and ensure GDPR compliance:

**1. Establish Clear Data Processing Agreements:**
 - **Contracts:** Ensure that all data processing activities are governed by well-defined contracts that delineate responsibilities and obligations, in line with GDPR requirements (Article 28).
 - **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review and update these agreements to reflect any changes in data processing activities or regulatory requirements.

**2. Implement Robust Data Protection Policies:**
 - **CCTV Policies:** Develop and enforce comprehensive policies for the management and security of CCTV footage, including access control, storage, and transmission protocols.
 - **Employee Training:** Conduct regular training sessions to ensure that all personnel understand and comply with data protection policies and procedures.

**3. Enhance Data Subject Access Request Processes:**
 - **Timely Responses:** Implement a streamlined process for handling DSARs to ensure timely responses within the prescribed legal timeframe.
 - **Tracking System:** Use tracking systems to monitor the status of access requests and ensure accountability.

**4. Strengthen Security Measures:**
 - **Technical Controls:** Deploy appropriate technical measures such as encryption, access controls, and secure transmission methods to protect personal data.
 - **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and forensic investigations to detect and address any potential vulnerabilities or unauthorized disclosures.

**5. Ensure Accountability and Compliance:**
 - **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of all data processing activities and security measures to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles (Article 5(2)).
 - **Incident Response:** Develop and test incident response plans to promptly address data breaches and mitigate their impact.

### Reflections
Analyzing the 2018 Case Study 5: Disclosure of CCTV footage from a direct provision centre illuminated key GDPR compliance aspects, particularly the importance of timely Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs), formal data processing agreements, robust security measures, and maintaining accountability. The case underscored the severe consequences of inadequate data protection practices, emphasizing that non-compliance can significantly infringe on individual rights. As a Data Protection Officer, the insights gained highlight the necessity for clear contracts, comprehensive policies, regular training, and rigorous security protocols to safeguard personal data effectively and ensure GDPR compliance. Recently, I also drafted a CCTV policy for the company I work for. The deep analysis of this case study was invaluable in providing a strong foundation for ensuring GDPR compliance regarding CCTV usage.
