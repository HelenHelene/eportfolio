# Optional Activity – GDPR Case Studies

Read the [Data Protection Commission (2020)](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies) Case Studies.
There are several case studies from 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches. 
Chose a case study (should be unique to each student) and answer the following questions:

 - What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?
 - How was it resolved?
 - If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?
This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and is a component of the e-portfolio.
You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports).
