These standards are essential for protecting personal data, payment information, and health information. They provide guidelines for organizations to implement strong security measures and maintain compliance to protect sensitive information. Below are the key aspects of each standard:

#### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law implemented by the European Union (EU) that has been in effect since May 25, 2018. GDPR is designed to protect the personal data and privacy of individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also regulates the transfer of personal data outside these regions.

Key aspects of GDPR include:
 - **Data Protection Principles:** Ensuring personal data is processed legally, fairly, and transparently.
 - **Data Subject Rights:** Giving individuals rights such as access to their data, the right to correct or delete it, and the right to data portability.
 - **Accountability and Governance:** Requiring organizations to show they comply with GDPR through proper documentation and assessments.
 - **Penalties:** Imposing high fines for non-compliance, up to €20 million or 4% of the global annual turnover, whichever is higher.
   
#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. These standards were developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC).

Key components of PCI DSS include:
 - **Build and Maintain a Secure Network:** Installing and maintaining firewalls to protect cardholder data.
 - **Protect Cardholder Data:** Encrypting cardholder data during transmission over public networks.
 - **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program:** Using and regularly updating antivirus software and developing secure systems.
 - **Implement Strong Access Control Measures:** Limiting access to cardholder data based on business needs and assigning unique IDs to each person with computer access.
 - **Monitor and Test Networks:** Regularly checking networks to ensure security measures are effective.
 - **Maintain an Information Security Policy:** Developing a security policy for employees and contractors.

#### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a U.S. law enacted in 1996 that provides data privacy and security for safeguarding medical information. It aims to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge.

Key rules under HIPAA include:
 - **Privacy Rule:** Sets national standards for the protection of health information and limits its use and disclosure without patient permission.
 - **Security Rule:** Requires organizations to implement safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic health information.
 - **Breach Notification Rule:** Requires notifications to be sent out if there is a breach of unsecured health information.
 - **Enforcement Rule:** Details how investigations and penalties for HIPAA violations are conducted, including civil and criminal penalties.
   

1. Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the organisation discussed in the assessment? For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to GDPR. A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet PCI-DSS standards.
   
2. Evaluate the company against the appropriate standards and decide how would you check if standards were being met?
   
3. What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?
   
4. What assumptions have you made?
