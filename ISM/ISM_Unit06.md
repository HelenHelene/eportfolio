# Unit 6: The Great Debate - What Will be the Most Influential Trend in ISM in the Next 5 Years?

In Unit 6, we debated the question, "What will be the most influential trend in security and risk management (SRM) in the next 5 years?". This debate was informed by the reading material and lecturecast from Unit 5, as well as our entries in the wiki created in Unit 5. This unit provided an opportunity to consolidate our learning and critically evaluate various emerging trends.

### Learning Outcomes:
This unit was crucial in synthesizing the knowledge from previous units and honing my ability to evaluate and argue for emerging trends. 
By the end of this unit, I was able to: 
 - Describe the main emerging trends in the field
 - Argue for which I believe to be the most influential
 - Cast my vote for the trend I support.

### Artefacts 
This week, I continued the development of the module wiki in Unit 5.

Moreover, I completed two assignments including the Executive Summary and App Presentation, and the Individual Reflection.

### Reflections
Unit 6 was a thought-provoking experience that emphasized the importance of critical thinking and debate in understanding future trends in SRM. Engaging in the debate helped me better articulate my views and understand opposing perspectives. The collaborative wiki development further reinforced my knowledge and provided a platform for collective learning.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
To build on the insights gained from Unit 6, I plan to engage in continuous learning by regularly participating in debates and discussions on emerging trends in SRM to stay updated and refine my critical thinking skills. Additionally, I aim to enhance my argumentation skills by developing my ability to construct and present compelling arguments through public speaking and writing exercises. Furthermore, I will promote collaborative learning by encouraging team-based discussions and knowledge sharing within my organization to foster a collaborative learning environment. These actions will help me stay informed about future trends and effectively contribute to strategic decision-making processes in SRM.
