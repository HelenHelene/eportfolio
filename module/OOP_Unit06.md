# Unit 6: Abstract Methods and Interfaces

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Review the Codio module Encapsulations and save the results in e-portfolio.
 - Continue to build e-Portfolio including writing the final reflection.

### Learning Outcomes
This week, we explore the concept of classes in Python further, in the sense of using abstract classes and interfaces to assign values to variables and execute methods. From a more theoretical context, we explore the metrics which are considered when evaluating the effectiveness of object oriented code.

In this unit we shall:
 - Consider the benefits of using interfaces in Python.
 - Develop a Python program which uses interfaces.
 - Recognise the metrics which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of an object oriented program.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Describe the ways in which interfaces support Python code design.
 - Write a Python program which applies interfaces.
 - Define the metrics by which an object oriented program can be assessed.

Practical work this week will support further understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by using abstract classes and interfaces. This will be core to supporting the development required for the coding contribution of the summative assessment.
