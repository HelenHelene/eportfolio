# Unit 6: Abstract Methods and Interfaces

During this unit, we delved deeper into the concept of classes in Python, specifically focusing on the usage of abstract classes and interfaces to assign variable values and execute methods. Additionally, we explored the theoretical context of evaluating the effectiveness of object-oriented code.

### Learning Outcomes
The learning outcomes of this unit include the ability to:
 - Describe how interfaces support the design of Python code.
 - Write a Python program that implements interfaces.
 - Define the metrics used to assess an object-oriented program.

### Artefacts
Aside from continuing to build my e-portfolio, I also completed the following projects, which are documented in the provided link:

[Encapsulations - Tutorial Labs](OOP_Unit06_TutorialLab.md)

[Encapsulations - Exercises](OOP_Unit06_CodioEx.md)

### Reflections
I have acquired a solid understanding of abstract classes and interfaces in Python. I now comprehend the benefits of utilizing interfaces in code design and have gained practical experience in implementing them. Additionally, I have learned about the metrics used to assess the effectiveness of OOP.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
I will apply the knowledge and skills I gained in this unit to extend the development of a Python program for the coding contribution required in the upcoming assessment. I will continue to strengthen my proficiency in using abstract classes and interfaces to create efficient and modular code.
