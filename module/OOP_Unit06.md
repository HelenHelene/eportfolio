# Unit 6: Abstract Methods and Interfaces

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Review the Codio module Encapsulations and save the results in e-portfolio.
 - Continue to build e-Portfolio including writing the final reflection.

---

This week, we explore the concept of classes in Python further, in the sense of using abstract classes and interfaces to assign values to variables and execute methods. From a more theoretical context, we explore the metrics which are considered when evaluating the effectiveness of object oriented code.

In this unit we shall:
 - Consider the benefits of using interfaces in Python.
 - Develop a Python program which uses interfaces.
 - Recognise the metrics which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of an object oriented program.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Describe the ways in which interfaces support Python code design.
 - Write a Python program which applies interfaces.
 - Define the metrics by which an object oriented program can be assessed.

Practical work this week will support further understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by using abstract classes and interfaces. This will be core to supporting the development required for the coding contribution of the summative assessment.
