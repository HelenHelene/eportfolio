# Unit 5: More on Classes

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Review the Codio module Inheritance and save the results in e-portfolio. 
 - Write a Python program with polymorphism that is usable within the summative assessment for the driverless car.

---

This week, we explore the concept of classes in Python further, in the sense of assigning variable values using a constructor, in addition to the use of an abstract class. Our examination of Python continues with an understanding of the modularity of Python, and the approaches to facilitating this using inheritance, aggregation, and composition.

In this unit we shall:
 - Consider the modularity of object oriented code and the use of abstract classes to facilitate inheritance.
 - Examine the different ways in which inheritance is enabled, using polymorphism, aggregation and composition.
 - Realise the role which is played by packages and namespaces in relation to variable naming.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Create a Python program which uses a constructor and abstract class.
 - Describe the concepts of polymorphism, aggregation and composition.
 - Name variables according to the namespace within which they exist.

Practical work this week will support further understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by using a constructor and abstract class within a Python program. This will be core to supporting the development required for the coding contribution of the summative assessment.
