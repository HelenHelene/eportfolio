# Unit 5: More on Classes

Throughout this unit, I explored the concept of classes in Python, with a specific emphasis on using constructors to assign variable values and employing abstract classes. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of Python's modularity and the different approaches to achieving it, such as inheritance, aggregation, and composition.

In summary, I achieved the following objectives in this unit:
Explored the modularity of object-oriented code and the facilitation of inheritance through abstract classes.
Examined the various ways in which inheritance is enabled, including polymorphism, aggregation, and composition.
Recognized the role played by packages and namespaces in relation to variable naming.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:
 - create Python programs that make use of constructors and abstract classes.
 - clear understanding of the concepts of polymorphism, aggregation, and composition.
 - became proficient in naming variables according to the appropriate namespace.

### Artefacts
As part of my e-portfolio, I completed the following artifacts which are documented in the provided link:

### Reflections
I am pleased with the progress I made in understanding classes in Python and their practical implementation. I now grasp the significance of constructors and abstract classes in building efficient and modular code. Moreover, I appreciate the versatility of Python in enabling modularity through inheritance, aggregation, and composition.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
The practical work during this week significantly contributed to my understanding of how to extend Python programs by employing constructors and abstract classes. This knowledge will be crucial in meeting the coding requirements of the upcoming assessment.
Moving forward, I will also identify areas where I need further learning to strengthen my proficiency in Python programming and object-oriented concepts.
