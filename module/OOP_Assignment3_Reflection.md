### Introduction
Reflecting on my journey through the [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](OOP.md) module of my MSc in Computer Science, I feel both challenged and enriched. This module has deepened my technical skills and significantly impacted my professional and personal development.

### Project Outcomes and Key Learnings
Throughout this module, I have learned a lot about the key features of OOP, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts were difficult at first, but through continuous practice, they have become a part of my programming approach.

The assignments focused on designing and implementing software for a driverless car. This real-world application of OOP principles was both exciting and intimidating. For [Assignment 1](OOP_Assignment1.md), I researched driverless cars and their main features, prepared UML models, and designed a comprehensive software proposal. This process required extensive research, enhancing my skills in UML diagram preparation and system design.

[Assignment 2](OOP_Assignment2.md) was even more challenging, requiring the actual implementation of the driverless car system using Python. Despite being a beginner, I leveraged the research from Assignment 1 and the knowledge gained from Codio exercises and lab sessions to develop software supporting driverless cars. This hands-on experience was invaluable, reinforcing my learning and boosting my confidence in tackling complex programming tasks.

For the collaborative discussion, it was an interesting experience for me as I rarely discuss topics in a forum. We had to conduct research before making an initial post, review other posts and comments, and then make a summary post. This process not only accumulated knowledge on professional topics but also trained my reflection and critical thinking skills.

For the [e-portfolio submission](https://helenhelene.github.io/eportfolio/), I am unsure if it just needs to save all artifacts in a folder on GitHub or if it needs a website hosted by GitHub. However, I prefer to host it as a website for a better view. This would also allow me to record my entire MSc computer science journey and use it as a reference in the future. You may also find an [About Me](https://helenhelene.github.io/eportfolio/Professional.html) section on the website hosted by GitHub. I separate [each unit with individual learning outcomes and reflections](OOP.md). I also provide a quick access option for the [list of artifacts](OOP_ArtefactsSummary.md), which collectively document the learning journey and practical application of concepts throughout the OOP module.

### Analysis and Impact
The workload of this module was substantial, especially for a part-time student. The constant pressure and the need to master new and complex OOP concepts often felt overwhelming. However, this pressure also drove me to manage my time effectively and seek help when necessary. The successful completion of assignments, especially seeing a program run without bugs and publishing a real website on GitHub, was very satisfying and showed the tangible outcomes of my hard work.

Reflecting on my emotions, I realized that the initial stress gradually transformed into a deep sense of accomplishment as I progressed through the module. Engaging with peers and reviewing literature provided a broader perspective on my work and behavior, further enriching my learning experience. This module has significantly impacted my professional development, with the skills and knowledge gained being directly applicable to my career. Personally, the experience has taught me resilience and the importance of continuous learning. The high workload and challenging content have prepared me to handle similar pressures in future professional settings.

In [Unit 1](OOP_Unit01.md), we reviewed the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021) on e-portfolios. Initially, I viewed the requirement to maintain an e-portfolio as an unnecessary task. However, I have come to appreciate its value in promoting reflective and deeper learning. This realization has changed my approach to the e-portfolio, seeing it as a tool for documenting and reflecting on my learning journey, which will be invaluable for my future career.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Development Plan
The knowledge and skills developed during this module, such as creating UML diagrams, implementing OOP principles in Python, and using GitHub for version control and collaboration, are invaluable. Specifically, the UML practice is directly transferable to real-world projects in my current management role. The knowledge of UML I gained from this module makes it easier to communicate between top management and information technology teams, particularly in projects that require designing and implementing complex systems.

Please refer to the Professional Skills Matrix for the OOP Module below.

| **Skill** | **Description** | **Level Before Module** | **Level After Module**  | **Evidence** |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------- |
| Time Management | Managing time to meet deadlines and balance workload between current career and staggering modules. | Intermediate | Advanced | Completed assignments on time despite high workload. | 
| Critical Thinking and Analysis | Evaluating information to make well-informed decisions and solve problems. | Intermediate | Advanced | Applied critical thinking in project evaluations and literature reviews. |
| Problem-Solving | Developing and implementing effective strategies to resolve issues. | Intermediate | Advanced | Implemented a driverless car system using OOP principles. |
| Communication and Literacy Skills | Collaborative discussion and idea presentation. | Basic | Intermediate | Participated in discussions, created project proposals with UML diagrams, and maintained an e-portfolio. |
| IT and Digital | OOP, Python Programming, UML diagram, and GitHub. | Basic | Intermediate | Completed assignments, prepared detailed UML models, implemented driverless car software with OOP principles, and published a website on GitHub. |
| Critical Reflection | Reflecting on experiences to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. | Basic | Intermediate | Maintained an e-portfolio with reflections and learning outcomes for each unit. |

The challenges faced in this module have shown me the importance of continuous learning and adaptation. I intend to keep building on the foundations laid during this course by engaging with advanced topics in OOP and exploring other programming languages. Additionally, I will continue to refine my skills in using development tools and platforms like Codio, Jupyter Notebook, and Draw.io. I also plan to explore advanced topics in Python, such as game development with Pygame (Pygame, 2024), to broaden my programming capabilities and apply them to more diverse projects.

### Conclusion
In summary, the OOP module has been a transformative experience. It has equipped me with essential technical skills, fostered a deeper understanding of reflective practice, and significantly impacted my professional and personal development. As I move forward, I am committed to applying the knowledge and skills gained to real-world projects, continuing my learning journey, and contributing to software development practices.

Reflecting on this journey has been enlightening, helping me to consolidate my learnings and prepare for future challenges. The experiences and insights gained will undoubtedly serve as a strong foundation for my ongoing growth and success in the field of computer science.
