# Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Continue to build e-Portfolio including writing the final reflection.

---

### Learning Outcomes
This week we shall experiment further with the creation of other UML models, including the activity diagram.

In this unit we shall:
 - Experiment with further UML models, including a class diagram.
 - Write a Python program which implements the UML class diagram.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Prepare a class diagram which corresponds to a system which will be implemented.
 - Take a UML model and implement software using it.

The content this week supports students in taking UML models and developing the corresponding code. This will be critical in support of the summative assessment, when students create code for the Week 11 submission from the design documents submitted in Week 7.
