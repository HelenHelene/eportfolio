# Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice

This unit I have experiment further with the creation of other UML models, including the activity diagram by following tasks.
 - Experiment with further UML models, including a class diagram.
 - Write a Python program which implements the UML class diagram.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Prepare a class diagram which corresponds to a system which will be implemented.
 - Take a UML model and implement software using it.

### Artefacts
Continue to build e-Portfolio.

### Reflections
in this unit, i have better understanding for different UML models and keep practise in draw.io.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
The content this week supports me in taking UML models and developing the corresponding code. This will be critical in support of the assigment design documents.
