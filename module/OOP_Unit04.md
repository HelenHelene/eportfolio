# Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice

In this unit, I delved further into the practical application of UML models in program implementation by exploring additional UML models, including the activity and class diagram.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I have achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - Prepared a different diagram that accurately corresponds to a system to be implemented.
 - Implemented software by utilizing a UML model.

### Artefacts
Continued building my e-Portfolio to document my progress and achievements.

### Reflections
Throughout this unit, I had the opportunity to explore different integrated development environments (IDEs) and Python debugging tools such as PyCharm. Additionally, I practiced using draw.io to improve my skills and mindset in creating various UML diagrams. These activities have deepened my appreciation for the tools and resources that enhance developer productivity.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
The reading lists covered in this unit has provided invaluable support in translating UML models into executable code. This knowledge will be crucial in developing the design documents for the assignment. Moving forward, I will continue to apply the skills and techniques learned to ensure the successful implementation of software systems based on UML models.
