# Unit 10: Testing Code in Practice

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Collaborative Discussion 2 - OO Design for IoT-Summary post
 - Continue to build e-Portfolio including writing the final reflection.

---

This week, we will examine the approaches to packaging Python code so that it is presented in a user-friendly manner for stakeholders. Prior to releasing code to stakeholders, we must ensure that it meets the client’s needs and that it has been fully tested. We will therefore also examine several approaches to test both the logic and syntax of the code created.

In this unit we shall:
 - Apply unit tests to test the functionality of Python code.
 - Use the pylint testing tool to automatically check acceptability of the style used to write the Python code.
 - Experiment with approaches to commenting inline and documenting code.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Write unit tests to ensure correct functionality of Python code.
 - Run pylint against a Python script to demonstrate stylistic correctness.
 - Document code for release to stakeholders.

After developing Python code, this week’s content supports students in testing their code for functional correctness, in addition to accurate stylistic convention. This will be important for the code submitted as part of the summative assessment in Week 11.
