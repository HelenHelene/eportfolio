# Unit 10: Testing Code in Practice

During Unit 10, we focused on the crucial aspects of packaging Python code in a user-friendly manner for stakeholders. We recognized the significance of thoroughly testing the code to ensure it meets the client's requirements before its release. Additionally, we explored various approaches to test both the logic and syntax of the code created.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout this unit, we accomplished the following learning outcomes:
 - Applied unit tests to verify the functionality of Python code, ensuring its correct operation.
 - Utilized the pylint testing tool to automatically assess the adherence to stylistic conventions in writing Python code.
 - Explored different approaches to inline commenting and documenting code for clarity and comprehension.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion
Aside from continuing to build my e-portfolio, I also participated in collaborative discussions, as documented in the provided link:

### Reflections
I have gained valuable insights into the process of packaging Python code and the importance of comprehensive testing. Through the application of unit tests, I have learned how to ensure the correct functionality of Python code. Utilizing pylint has enabled me to assess the stylistic correctness of my code, maintaining consistency and readability.

Moreover, I have explored different approaches to commenting and documenting code, enhancing its readability and facilitating future maintenance and collaboration.

Looking ahead to the Assessment 2, the content covered in this unit will play a vital role. The ability to test code for functional correctness, as well as adhere to accurate stylistic conventions, will be crucial in delivering a high-quality software solution.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
In terms of my professional skills matrix and action plan, I will apply the knowledge gained in this unit to thoroughly test the code I have developed for the summative assessment. By leveraging unit tests and pylint, I aim to ensure the correctness and stylistic integrity of my code. Additionally, I will focus on documenting the code effectively, providing clear explanations for stakeholders.
