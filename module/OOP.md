# Module 2 Object Oriented Programming

This module focuses on utilizing the Python programming language for designing and developing object-oriented programs. It emphasizes the use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to support the object-oriented analysis and design process, with a particular focus on the four key features of Object-Oriented Programs (OOP): abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Two of the assignments in this module involves designing and implementing software to support the operation of a driverless car. The objectives of these assignments include preparing UML models for the object-oriented design process, applying data structures for efficient data storage, and implementing data search algorithms for optimal data processing.

Additionally, there are formative and e-portfolio activities that require a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incidents (WHAT), analysis and interpretation of the information (SO WHAT), and reflection on how the information and learning can be applied (NOW WHAT).

The units provided below serve as a collection of evidence for the work completed in this module and serve as an account of the learning journey.

#### [Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm](https://helenhelene.github.io/eportfolio/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
 - Collaborative Discussion 1 - Initial post
 - Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). Discuss one aspect of this article which you find unexpected.
 - Develop a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it.

#### Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python
 - Collaborative Discussion 1 - Respond to peers
 - Review the Codio module Class, Functions and Methods and save the results in e-portfolio.
 - (Optional)Write a Python program to achieve basic employee-related functionality with protected and unprotected variables. 

#### Unit 3-4: UML
 - Collaborative Discussion 1 - Summary post 
 - Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 - Making reference to ‘The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition’, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to design a similar model for a washing machine.

#### Unit 5: More on Classes
 - Review the Codio module Inheritance and save the results in e-portfolio. 
 - Write a Python program with polymorphism that is usable within the summative assessment for the driverless car.

#### Unit 6: Abstract Methods and Interfaces
 - Writing final reflection in e-Portfolio.
 - Review the Codio module Encapsulations and save the results in e-portfolio.

#### Unit 7: Debugging / Error Handling, Data Structures and Data Search
 - Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development with examples of three different data structures.
 - Create a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods:
     items()
     keys()
     values()
 - Read the article by Kampffmeyer & Zschaler (2007). Develop a program which allows a user to enter the properties which they require of a design pattern, and have the program make a recommendation. The program should use a constructor to initialise attributes and assign values to variables based on input entered by the user.

#### Python-Driverless Car-System Design

#### Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice
 - Collaborative Discussion 2 - OO Design for IoT-Initial Post
 - Review the Recursion and Polymorphism Codio modules and save the results in your e-portfolio.

#### Unit 9: Packaging and Testing
 - Collaborative Discussion 2 - OO Design for IoT-Respond to peers
 - How relevant is the cyclomatic complexity in object oriented systems and other questions.
 - To what extent is cyclomatic complexity relevant when developing object-oriented code?
 - What is the cyclomatic complexity of the piece of code in this activity.
 - Extend the Python String program in this activity to test accuracy of operations using the assert statement.
