# Module 2 Object Oriented Programming

This module focuses on utilizing the Python programming language for designing and developing object-oriented programs. It emphasizes the use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to support the object-oriented analysis and design process, with a particular focus on the four key features of Object-Oriented Programs (OOP): abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Two of the assignments in this module involves designing and implementing software to support the operation of a driverless car. The objectives of these assignments include preparing UML models for the object-oriented design process, applying data structures for efficient data storage, and implementing data search algorithms for optimal data processing.

Additionally, there are formative and e-portfolio activities that require a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incidents (WHAT), analysis and interpretation of the information (SO WHAT), and reflection on how the information and learning can be applied (NOW WHAT).

The units provided below serve as a collection of evidence for the work completed in this module and serve as an account of the learning journey.

#### [Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm](OOP_Unit01.md)

#### [Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python](OOP_Unit02.md)

#### [Unit 3: UML](OOP_Unit03.md)

#### Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice
