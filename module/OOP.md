# Module 2 Object Oriented Programming

This module focuses on utilizing the Python programming language for designing and developing object-oriented programs. It emphasizes the use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to support the object-oriented analysis and design process, with a particular focus on the four key features of Object-Oriented Programs (OOP): abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Two of the assignments in this module involves designing and implementing software to support the operation of a driverless car. The objectives of these assignments include preparing UML models for the object-oriented design process, applying data structures for efficient data storage, and implementing data search algorithms for optimal data processing.
