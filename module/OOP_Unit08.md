# Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Collaborative Discussion 2 - OO Design for IoT-Initial Post
 - Review the Recursion and Polymorphism Codio modules and save the results in e-portfolio.

---

This week, we will experiment with operations which may be applied to data structures, in addition to examining the ways in which data search algorithms are implemented.

In this unit we shall:
 - Examine the operations which may be applied to sets, including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
 - Gain an appreciation of the linear data search technique.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Describe the scenarios in which each of the set operations will be applicable in relation to the driverless car scenario.
 - Implement a linear data search technique.

The practical work this week will support students in implementing the key features required of their summative code assessment, which include data structures and data search algorithms.

### Learning Outcomes
I will learn:

### Artefacts
These are the projects carried out to meet those learning outcomes, which are described in the link below.

### Collaborative Discussion and meeting notes
Notes from various meetings, as well as feedback from team members and tutors.

### Reflections
What exactly have I learnt and how?

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
What skills have I gained or enhanced as a result of this module and how can I use it? What else do I need to learn?
