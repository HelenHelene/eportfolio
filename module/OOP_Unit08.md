# Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice

Throughout this unit, we explored the practical implementation of data structures and data search algorithms. The focus was on experimenting with various operations applicable to data structures and gaining hands-on experience with data search techniques. This practical work aimed to support us in implementing the essential features required for our summative code assessment, which involve data structures and data search algorithms.

### Learning Outcomes
During this unit, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:
 - Described the scenarios in which specific set operations, such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, are applicable within the context of the driverless car scenario.
 - Implemented a linear data search technique, gaining a practical understanding of its application and functionality.

### Reflections
I have learned how to apply different operations to sets and understand their relevance in the driverless car scenario. Additionally, I have gained hands-on experience in implementing a linear data search technique.

In terms of professional skills, I have improved my ability to work with data structures and employ data search algorithms effectively. These skills are crucial in developing efficient and optimized code. However, there is still more to learn and explore in the realm of data structures and advanced search algorithms.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Moving forward, I will apply the skills I have acquired in this unit to enhance the functionality of my summative code assessment. Additionally, I will continue to expand my knowledge and proficiency in working with different data structures and exploring more advanced data search techniques.
