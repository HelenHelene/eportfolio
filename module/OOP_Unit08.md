# Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice

Throughout this unit, we explored the practical implementation of data structures and data search algorithms. The focus was on experimenting with various operations applicable to data structures and gaining hands-on experience with data search techniques. This practical work aimed to support us in implementing the essential features required for our summative code assessment, which involve data structures and data search algorithms.

### Learning Outcomes
During this unit, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:
 - Described the scenarios in which specific set operations, such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, are applicable within the context of the driverless car scenario.
 - Implemented a linear data search technique, gaining a practical understanding of its application and functionality.
   
### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
I have completed the following projects to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

### Reflections
Throughout this unit, I have acquired valuable knowledge on applying various operations to sets and comprehended their significance in the context of the driverless car scenario. Furthermore, I have gained practical experience by implementing a linear data search technique.

In addition to that, my proficiency in working with data structures has significantly improved, and I have honed my skills in employing data search algorithms with effectiveness. These capabilities are essential in the development of code that is efficient and optimized.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Moving forward, I will apply the skills I have acquired in this unit to enhance the functionality of my summative code assessment. Additionally, I will continue to expand my knowledge and proficiency in working with different data structures and exploring more advanced data search techniques.
