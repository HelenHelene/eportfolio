# Unit 3: UML

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Collaborative Discussion 1 - Factors which Influence Reusability-Summary post 
 - [Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.html)
 - Making reference to ‘The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition’, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to design a similar model for a washing machine.

This week, we will gain exposure to the Unified Modelling Language (UML). This is a standardised toolset to represent software systems on paper prior to their conversion into code.

In this unit we shall:
 - Be exposed to the common syntax used by the Unified Modelling Language.
 - Explore the major UML models which are used throughout the object oriented analysis, design and development process.
 - Design UML models to represent aspects of specific software systems.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Recognise the syntax used to design UML models.
 - Distinguish between the UML models which are applicable at various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
 - Develop UML models using open source tools.

The UML content this week is important in support of the design document that will be submitted in Week 6. The UML models will be used to design the software system on paper prior to its implementation in Python.
