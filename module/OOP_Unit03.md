# Unit 3: UML

This unit focuses on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is a standardized toolset for representing software systems before they are translated into code.

In this unit, I have accomplished the following tasks:
 - Familiarized myself with the common syntax used in UML.
 - Explored the major UML models utilized in the object-oriented analysis, design, and development process.
 - Designed UML models to represent specific aspects of software systems.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this unit, I have achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - Recognize the syntax employed in designing UML models.
 - Differentiate between the UML models applicable at various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
 - Develop UML models using open-source tools.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion
I have completed the following activties to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - Factors which Influence Reusability-Summary post](https://helenhelene.github.io/eportfolio/pdf/Module02_Discussion1_Summary.pdf) 

[Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the SDLC.](OOP_Unit03_Discuss.md)

[State Machine Diagram for a washing machine.](OOP_Unit03_StateMach.md)

### Reflections
The collaborative discussion summary post provided valuable insights from diverse perspectives on reusability, expanding my knowledge beyond what is covered in the book. Through exploring UML models, I gained a better understanding of their relationship with the SDLC. Additionally, while completing the exercise of creating a State Machine Diagram, I explored different diagram drawing tools such as MS Visio, Lucid, and draw.io.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
Throughout this unit, I gained knowledge of UML modeling and its application in SDLC. By actively practicing and utilizing open-source tools like draw.io, I honed my skills in creating comprehensive UML models. To further enhance my proficiency, I explored different UML modeling tools and platforms, adapting to their functionalities. 
Moving forward, I will continue to apply these skills in designing software systems prior to their implementation.
