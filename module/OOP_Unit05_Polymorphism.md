### Example with Polymorphism

#### Base Detection Class

```python
class Detection:
    def update_data(self, *args):
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be overridden by subclasses")

    def detect(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be overridden by subclasses")
```

#### Lane Detection Class

```python
class LaneDetect(Detection):
    def __init__(self):
        self.lane_left = 0.0
        self.lane_right = 0.0
        self.deviation = 0.0
        self.deviation_detect = False

    def update_data(self, lane_left, lane_right, deviation):
        self.lane_left = lane_left
        self.lane_right = lane_right
        self.deviation = deviation

    def detect(self):
        self.deviation_detect = self.deviation > 0.1  # Example condition
        return self.deviation_detect

    def correct_lane(self):
        if self.deviation_detect:
            print("Correcting lane...")
```

#### Obstacle Detection Class

```python
class ObstacleDetect(Detection):
    def __init__(self):
        self.obstacle_detect = False
        self.distance = 0.0
        self.min_distance = 5.0

    def update_data(self, distance):
        self.distance = distance

    def detect(self):
        self.obstacle_detect = self.distance < self.min_distance
        return self.obstacle_detect

    def slow(self):
        if self.obstacle_detect:
            print("Slowing down due to obstacle...")
```

#### Driverless Car Class

```python
class DriverlessCar:
    def __init__(self, max_speed):
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.maintain_speed = True
        self.detection_systems = []  # List to hold all detection systems

    def add_detection_system(self, system):
        if isinstance(system, Detection):
            self.detection_systems.append(system)
        else:
            raise TypeError("System must be an instance of Detection")

    def move(self):
        print("Car is moving...")

    def check_systems(self):
        for system in self.detection_systems:
            if system.detect():
                if isinstance(system, LaneDetect):
                    system.correct_lane()
                elif isinstance(system, ObstacleDetect):
                    system.slow()

    def stop(self):
        print("Car is stopping...")

# Usage
car = DriverlessCar(max_speed=100)
lane_detection = LaneDetect()
obstacle_detection = ObstacleDetect()

car.add_detection_system(lane_detection)
car.add_detection_system(obstacle_detection)

car.move()
lane_detection.update_data(0.5, 0.6, 0.2)
obstacle_detection.update_data(4.5)
car.check_systems()  # This will correct the lane and slow down due to obstacle
car.stop()
```

#### Explanation
 - Polymorphic Base Class: The Detection class provides a polymorphic base with abstract methods update_data and detect that must be implemented by subclasses.
 - Lane Detection: The LaneDetect class inherits from Detection and implements the update_data and detect methods. It also includes a specific method correct_lane.
 - Obstacle Detection: The ObstacleDetect class also inherits from Detection and implements the update_data and detect methods. It includes a specific method slow.
 - Driverless Car: The DriverlessCar class maintains a list of detection systems. It uses polymorphism to handle different detection systems uniformly. The check_systems method iterates through the detection systems and calls their detect method, and then performs specific actions based on the type of system.

By using polymorphism, the driverless car program can easily extend to include new types of detection systems without modifying the existing codebase significantly. This approach enhances the maintainability and scalability of the system.
