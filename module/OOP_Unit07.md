### Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development with examples of three different data structures.

     items()
     keys()
     values()
 - Read the article by Kampffmeyer & Zschaler (2007). Develop a program which allows a user to enter the properties which they require of a design pattern, and have the program make a recommendation.
