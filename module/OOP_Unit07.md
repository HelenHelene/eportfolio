# Unit 7: Debugging / Error Handling, Data Structures and Data Search

In this unit, we explored the essential aspects of debugging code and handling errors. We acknowledged the various ways in which errors can be introduced into code and examined the tools available in Python to facilitate error detection. Following this, we delved into the concept of data structures, which are instrumental in organizing and processing data, along with different search techniques for efficient data retrieval. The content covered in this unit aimed to equip us with the skills necessary to develop high-quality code and effectively manage and process diverse types of data, all of which are crucial for the Assignment 2 System Implementation.

Throughout this unit, I accomplished the following objectives:
 - Developed an understanding of the importance of debugging code and became familiar with common types of errors that can occur in a program.
 - Explored the role of linters in supporting the development of high-quality code.
 - Gained knowledge about various data structures available in Python and their application in storing and organizing data.
 - Evaluated the effectiveness of different search techniques to retrieve data from stored collections.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this unit, I am able to:
 - Utilize Python tools to assess and improve the quality of code.
 - Implement appropriate data structures to effectively store and manage data.
 - Apply suitable search algorithms to efficiently navigate and retrieve information from stored data.

### Artefacts
As part of my e-portfolio, I completed the following artifacts which are documented in the provided link:

[Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development with examples of three different data structures](OOP_Unit07_Activity1.md)

[Create a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods: items(), keys(), values()](OOP_Unit07_Activity2.md)
     

### Reflections
I have acquired a deeper understanding of debugging techniques, error handling, and the significance of employing appropriate data structures and search algorithms. The practical implementation of these concepts has enhanced my ability to develop high-quality code and efficiently manage and process data.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
For the next step, I will utilize the skills I have gained in this unit to improve the quality and reliability of my code. Additionally, I will continue to explore and expand my knowledge of advanced data structures and search algorithms to further enhance my programming capabilities.
