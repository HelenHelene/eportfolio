# Unit 7: Debugging / Error Handling, Data Structures and Data Search

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development with examples of three different data structures.
 - Create a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods:
     items()
     keys()
     values()
 - Read the article by Kampffmeyer & Zschaler (2007). Develop a program which allows a user to enter the properties which they require of a design pattern, and have the program make a recommendation. The program should use a constructor to initialise attributes and assign values to variables based on input entered by the user.

This week we will consider how to debug code and handle errors. This recognises the variety of ways in which errors may be incorporated into code, in addition to the tools available in Python to support error detection. Content this week will then progress into the concept of data structures which are used to organise data and search techniques to process the stored values.

In this unit we shall:
 - Gain an understanding of the need to debug code and the typical types of errors which can be found in a program.
 - Examine the ability of linters to support the development of high quality code.
 - Become familiar with a range of data structures which may be used to store data.
 - Explore the effectiveness of different search techniques to examine the stored data.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Apply Python tools to examine the quality of code.
 - Implement data structures to store data.
 - Implement a search algorithm to explore stored data.

The content this week will support students in developing high quality code, in addition to organising and processing data in the most effective manner in relation to the type of data being considered. This will be important in relation to the summative code development submitted in Week 11.
