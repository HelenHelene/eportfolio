# Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Collaborative Discussion 1 - Factors which Influence Reusability-Respond to peers
 - Review the Codio module Class, Functions and Methods and save the results in e-portfolio.
 - (Optional)Write a Python program to achieve basic employee-related functionality with protected and unprotected variables.

---

### Learning Outcomes
In this unit we shall:
 - Explore the ways in which actors interact with software in terms of the functional requirements of a piece of software.
 - Identify the interactions and behaviours invoked within software once active using a state machine diagram.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Design a use case diagram for a software development scenario.
 - Create a state machine diagram to examine the behaviours and interactions within a system.

Practical work this week will support further understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by appreciating the retention of data as variables, and the assignment of variables across difference instances of a class. This will be core to supporting the development required for the coding contribution of the summative assessment. Exploration of the use of the Unified Modelling Language will also be critical to supporting preparation of the design document for the Week 6 summative assessment.
