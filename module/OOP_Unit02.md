# Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python

During this unit, we ventured into the realm of developing Python programs by taking the initial steps and analyzing the program domain using use case and state machine diagrams.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I have achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - Designing a use case diagram for a software development scenario, which aids in understanding the requirements and interactions of the software.
 - Creating a state machine diagram to analyze and visualize the behaviors and interactions within a system.
   
### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following projects and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

### Reflections
Through engaging in collaborative discussions with my peers, I have had the opportunity to delve deeper into the concept of reusability. These discussions have not only expanded my understanding of reusability but have also strengthened my practical critical thinking skills.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
The practical work in Codio has supported my understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by appreciating the retention of data as variables and the assignment of variables across different instances of a class. This knowledge will be crucial in supporting the development required for the coding contribution to the summative assessment. Additionally, the exploration of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) will play a critical role in preparing the design document for the summative assessment.
