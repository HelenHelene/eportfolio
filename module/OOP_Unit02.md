# Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python

I have made some initial steps towards developing Python programs in this unit after analyzing the program domain using a use case diagram and a state machine diagram.

In this unit, I have tried:
 - Exploring the ways in which actors interact with software in terms of the functional requirements of a piece of software.
 - Identifying the interactions and behaviors invoked within software once active using a state machine diagram.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this unit, I am able to:
 - Design a use case diagram for a software development scenario.
 - Create a state machine diagram to examine the behaviors and interactions within a system.
   
### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion
I have completed the following projects to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

[(Optional)Write a Python program to achieve basic employee-related functionality with protected and unprotected variables.]
   
### Reflections
Through further discussions with peers in the collaborative discussion, I have gained a deeper understanding of reusability, which has also enhanced my practical critical thinking skills.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
The practical work in Codio has supported my understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by appreciating the retention of data as variables and the assignment of variables across different instances of a class. This knowledge will be crucial in supporting the development required for the coding contribution to the summative assessment. Additionally, the exploration of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) will play a critical role in preparing the design document for the summative assessment.
