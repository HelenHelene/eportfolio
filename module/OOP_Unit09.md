# Unit 9: Packaging and Testing

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Collaborative Discussion 2 - OO Design for IoT-Respond to peers
 - How relevant is the cyclomatic complexity in object oriented systems and other questions.
 - To what extent is cyclomatic complexity relevant when developing object-oriented code.
 - What is the cyclomatic complexity of the piece of code in this activity.
 - Extend the Python String program in this activity to test accuracy of operations using the assert statement.

---

During this week we will examine how to test a Python program, in addition to packaging it for distribution to stakeholders.

In this unit we shall:
 - Appreciate the concept of packaging a Python program.
 - How the PEP257 convention to document a Python program.
 - Describe the range of approaches used to test code.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Appropriately package a Python code development.
 - Adequately and effectively document your code.
 - Use the tools available in Python to test the quality of code.

The content this week will further help students with finalising the code developed for the summative assessment, with application of one of the last pieces of attention needed to check the quality.
