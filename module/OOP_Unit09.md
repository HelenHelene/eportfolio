# Unit 9: Packaging and Testing

Throughout this unit, we delved into the process of testing a Python program and packaging it for distribution to stakeholders. The focus was on understanding the importance of code testing and the significance of appropriately packaging a Python program for efficient distribution.

Key topics covered in this unit included:
 - Appreciating the concept of packaging a Python program, ensuring it is organized and structured for ease of distribution.
 - Understanding the PEP257 convention and its role in effectively documenting a Python program, enhancing its readability and maintainability.
 - Describing the range of approaches used to test code, ensuring its quality and functionality.

### Learning Outcomes
By the completion of this unit, I have achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - Acquired the ability to appropriately package a Python code development, ensuring it is well-organized and ready for distribution.
 - Developed proficiency in adequately and effectively documenting code, adhering to the PEP257 convention.
 - Utilized various tools available in Python to test the quality of code, ensuring its functionality and reliability.
   
### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion
I have completed the following activities and engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

Collaborative Discussion 2 - OO Design for IoT-Respond to peers: [Respond 1](https://helenhelene.github.io/eportfolio/pdf/Module02_Discussion2_Respond1.pdf) &

[Activity 1 - How relevant is the cyclomatic complexity in object oriented systems? Which alternative metrics do you consider to be more reflective of the complexity of a piece of code, in comparison to the number of independent paths through a program? Support your response using reference to the related academic literature.]
 
[Activity 2 - To what extent is cyclomatic complexity relevant when developing object-oriented code?]
 
[Activity 3 - What is the cyclomatic complexity of the following piece of code?]

[Activity 4 - Extend the following program to test accuracy of operations using the assert statement.]

### Reflections
I have gained a solid understanding of the importance of code testing, proper documentation, and efficient packaging in software development. These skills are crucial in delivering high-quality and reliable software solutions to stakeholders.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
In terms of professional skills, I have enhanced my ability to effectively package code, document it following conventions, and employ testing techniques to ensure code quality. These skills will be invaluable in my future software development endeavors. However, there is always room for further learning and improvement, particularly in exploring advanced testing methodologies and staying updated with best practices in packaging and documentation.
