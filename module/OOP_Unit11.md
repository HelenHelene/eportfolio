# Unit 11: Pointers, References & Memory, and Design Patterns

Throughout Unit 11, we explored the efficiencies of programming in Python and its distinctive feature of not utilizing pointers for memory management, in contrast to languages like C. We delved into the concept of design patterns and their role in organizing code in an object-oriented manner. Additionally, we examined the concept of sustainable code development and how object-oriented programming in Python facilitates this approach.

### Learning Outcomes
By the completion of this unit, I have achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - Described the overhead incurred in programming languages that use pointers, highlighting the benefits of Python's approach.
 - Discussed the reasons why Python is considered a more sustainable programming language compared to others, taking into account its design principles.
 - Experimented with the design of code using a range of design patterns, gaining hands-on experience in organizing code modules in an architectural manner.

### Artefacts
Aside from continuing to build my e-portfolio, I also completed the following activities, as documented in the provided link:

[Codio Advanced Topics in Object Oriented Programming](OOP_Unit11_CodioAdv.md)

### Reflections
I have gained a deeper understanding of the efficiencies and advantages of Python's approach to memory management without the need for explicit pointers. This knowledge will enable me to write more efficient and optimized code, appreciating the underlying mechanisms that contribute to Python's performance.

The mini game design in Codio's advanced topics has also enhanced my knowledge of Python, which will be a useful skill for further development.

Exploring various design patterns has broadened my perspective on code organization and modularity. By applying different design patterns, I can enhance the maintainability and reusability of my code, leading to more robust and scalable software solutions.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
I have enhanced my abilities in memory management, sustainable code development, and the application of design patterns. These skills will be invaluable in my future software development projects, allowing me to write efficient, sustainable, and maintainable code.

Moving forward, I will continue to expand my knowledge of design patterns, exploring additional patterns and their specific use cases.
