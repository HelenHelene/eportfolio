# Unit 11: Pointers, References & Memory, and Design Patterns

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Continue e-Portfolio updates.

---

This week will we continue to appreciate the features in Python around the efficiencies of programming and the lack of a need to use pointers to manage the organisation of memory. This is compared against the overhead of explicit memory management in other programming languages such as C. We will explore the use of design patterns to organise code in an object oriented, making comparisons between the creational, structural and behavioural variants. Finally, we will examine the concept of sustainable code development, and the way in which this is facilitated using an object oriented programming language such as Python.

In this unit we shall:
 - Gain an appreciation of the fact that Python does not use pointers, while other programming languages, such as C, do.
 - Understand that the way in which code is design can contribute a carbon footprint and consider the design and development of code to minimise this footprint.
 - Recognise that code may be organised in a variety of manners dependent on the way in which components will interact with one another.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Describe the overhead incurred in some programming languages other than Java as a result of their use of pointers.
 - Discuss the reasons why Python is a more sustainable programming language than others.
 - Experiment with the design of code using a variety of design patterns.

The content this week will support students in understanding how to organise code modules into an architectural form through the application of design patterns. The module also concludes the module by considering a by-product of writing efficient object oriented code, through its ability to support achievement of sustainable, and maintainable, design.
