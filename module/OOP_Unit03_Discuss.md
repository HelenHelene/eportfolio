### Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). 

This e-portfolio activity requires us to review the article "The Power of ePortfolio Development to Foster Reflective and Deeper Learning in an Online Graduate Adult Education Program" by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021) and discuss one aspect of this article which I find unexpected. 

Before reading this article, I believed that an e-portfolio was simply a tool used to document and showcase one's activities as evidence of their contributions in the learning journey. I was surprised by the authors' point that the e-portfolio experience not only serves this purpose but also promotes reflective and deeper learning, supported by their research findings.

Initially, I had never considered the true intention behind the e-portfolio, particularly the requirement to write reflections. In fact, I saw it as an unnecessary task. However, after reading the article, I have come to appreciate the idea and have started taking the e-portfolio building process more seriously.

Perhaps the intention behind discussing this article in Unit One was to help us understand what to expect when building our e-portfolios. By reviewing and discussing the article, we can better grasp the importance of reflection and its contribution to meaningful learning experiences. This realization has transformed my perspective on e-portfolios.

As I continue in this course, I anticipate that the insights gained from this article will guide me in creating an effective e-portfolio. I now understand that it is not merely a way to showcase achievements, but also a means of reflecting on my experiences and gaining a deeper understanding of the concepts encountered in my learning journey.
