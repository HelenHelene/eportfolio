### Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the SDLC. 

This activity requires us to discuss the appropriate use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) models in different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The choice of UML models depends on the specific stage of the SDLC and the information that needs to be conveyed.

When discussing UML models, we primarily focus on diagrams. According to IBM Documentation (2023), UML models provide an abstract view of the system, while diagrams offer concrete representations of the system.

Rumbaugh, Jacobson, and Booch (2004) provide a brief overview of UML and the diagrams used in different perspectives. Here, I will list the commonly used UML models and when they are most applicable:

#### Static view - Class diagram

The static view is displaed in class diagrams

are widely used during the design and implementation phases of the SDLC. They show the relationship between classes and their attributes in system's structure. Class diagrams help design the software architecture and establish the foundation for object-oriented programming. They show the overall structure of the system and facilitate communication between developers.

#### Design view - Component diagram
Component diagrams are applicable during the design and implementation phases of the SDLC. They illustrate the structure and organization of the software components or modules that make up the system. Component diagrams show the relationships between components, including dependencies, interfaces, and collaborations. They help understand the software architecture and promote modularity and reusability.
   
#### use case view - use case diagram
Use case diagrams are used in the early stages of the SDLC, such as when gathering and analyzing requirements. They show the system's functionalities from a user's perspective, depicting how users interact with the system. Use case diagrams help identify major system functions and define the project's scope.

#### activity view - activity diagram
Activity diagrams are useful during requirements analysis and system design. They present the flow of actions and activities within a system. Activity diagrams help model business processes, workflows, and the sequence of actions in a system. They are particularly helpful in understanding complex business logic.

#### state machine view - state machine diagram 
State machine diagrams are valuable in the design and development stages of the SDLC, especially for systems with complex states and behavior. They show the different states an object or system can be in and how it transitions between those states based on events or conditions. State machine diagrams are helpful when modeling systems with behavior that depends on their current state, such as user interfaces or control systems.

#### interaction view - sequence diagram
Sequence diagrams are primarily used during the design and implementation phases of the SDLC. They show the the sequence of interactions between objects over time. Sequence diagrams are useful for designing and documenting interactions between different components or objects in the system, especially in scenarios where the timing and order of messages are important.

#### deployment view - depolyment diagram
#### model management view - package diagram
