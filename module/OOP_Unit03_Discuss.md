### Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the SDLC. 

#### DRAFT
This activity request us to discuss the Unified Modeling Language (UML) model used in different stage of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The choice of UML models depends on which stage of the SDLC and the information that needs to be communicated. 

Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch (2004) outline a brief walkthrough of UML and diagrams used in different views.  here i summuarized the common used UML models and when they are most applicable: 


static view - class diagram

design view - internal structure, collaboration diagram, component diagram

use case view - use case diagram

state machine view - state machine diagram 

activity view - activity diagram

interaction view - sequence diagram, communication diagram

deployment view - depolyment diagram

model management view - package diagram




1. Use Case Diagrams:
   Use case diagrams are used in the early stages of the SDLC, such as when gathering and analyzing requirements. They show the system's functionalities from a user's perspective, depicting how users interact with the system. Use case diagrams help identify major system functions and define the project's scope.

2. Activity Diagrams:
   Activity diagrams are useful during requirements analysis and system design. They present the flow of actions and activities within a system. Activity diagrams help model business processes, workflows, and the sequence of actions in a system. They are particularly helpful in understanding complex business logic.

3. Class Diagrams:
   Class diagrams are widely used during the design and implementation phases of the SDLC. They show the relationship between classes and their attributes in system's structure. Class diagrams help design the software architecture and establish the foundation for object-oriented programming. They show the overall structure of the system and facilitate communication between developers.

4. Sequence Diagrams:
   Sequence diagrams are primarily used during the design and implementation phases of the SDLC. They show the the sequence of interactions between objects over time. Sequence diagrams are useful for designing and documenting interactions between different components or objects in the system, especially in scenarios where the timing and order of messages are important.

5. State Machine Diagrams:
   State machine diagrams are valuable in the design and development stages of the SDLC, especially for systems with complex states and behavior. They show the different states an object or system can be in and how it transitions between those states based on events or conditions. State machine diagrams are helpful when modeling systems with behavior that depends on their current state, such as user interfaces or control systems.

6. Component Diagrams:
   Component diagrams are applicable during the design and implementation phases of the SDLC. They illustrate the structure and organization of the software components or modules that make up the system. Component diagrams show the relationships between components, including dependencies, interfaces, and collaborations. They help understand the software architecture and promote modularity and reusability.
