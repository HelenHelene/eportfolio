# Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - Collaborative Discussion 1 - Factors which Influence Reusability-Initial post
 - Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). Discuss one aspect of this article which you find unexpected.
 - Develop a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it.

---

In this introduction to Python programming, we will gain an understanding of the evolution of programming languages towards object orientation, and beyond it in response to the challenges of programming in an object oriented way.
 
In this unit we shall:
 - Examine what it means for a program to be object oriented.
 - Explore the syntax used to define a Python class.
 - Investigate how to define different data types in Python.
   
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Describe the major features of an object oriented program, in the sense of having abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and including polymorphism.
 - Define a Python class.
 - Define a variety of data types to variables in a Python program and adapt the access modifier applied to each.

This unit will give exposure to the fundamental building blocks of a Python program, upon which advanced features of the programming language will be built in later weeks.
