# Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm

In this introductory unit on Python programming, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of programming languages towards object orientation, as well as the challenges and benefits associated with programming in an object-oriented way.

Throughout this unit, I accomplished the following objectives:
 - Explored the concept and characteristics of object-oriented programming (OOP).
 - Examined the syntax used to define classes in Python.
 - Investigated the implementation of different data types in Python.
  
### Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this unit, I am able to:
 - Describe the major features of an object-oriented program, including abstract classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
 - Define a Python class.
 - Define various data types and adapt the access modifiers applied to them within a Python program.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following projects and participated in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

### Reflections
This unit provided me with essential knowledge about the fundamental building blocks of Python programming. These concepts serve as a solid foundation for understanding and utilizing more advanced features of the language in subsequent units.

After reviewing and discussing the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021), I gained a better understanding of the reasons behind the ongoing process of building our e-portfolios. This experience also transformed my perspective on e-portfolios.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
As a result of this module, I have gained a deep understanding of the importance of OOP and its core concepts, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and composition. I have also become familiar with key terminology related to OOP and factors that influence reusability.

In order to further enhance my skills, I will continue to apply these concepts in practical programming scenarios and explore advanced topics within Python and OOP.
