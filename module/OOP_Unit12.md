# Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code

Formative and e-portfolio activities in this unit:
 - The final assessment is e-portfolio that collects all the evidence of work in this module

---

In this week we will examine the application of design patterns to structure code.

In this unit we shall:
 - Examine the factory design pattern and consider how it may be implemented in software.
 - Consider the fact that multiple design patterns may be applied alongside one another in a single code development.
 - Recognise that some design patterns are more likely to be used with others in a single code development.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Write a Python program which applies a factory design pattern to generate objects.
 - Discuss the fact that multiple design patterns are able to be applied together to support a single code development.
 - Describe the design patterns which are more likely to be applied with one another in a single code package.

The content this week will support students in understanding how code may be structured from an architectural perspective using design patterns. This will inform on the relationships between different modules of the system, allowing their shaping depending on interactive behaviour. Student attention will be brought to the fact that more than one design pattern may be applied within a single code development, with attention also being given to the fact that some design patterns fit together more easily and realistically than others.

### Learning Outcomes
I will learn:

### Artefacts
These are the projects carried out to meet those learning outcomes, which are described in the link below.

### Collaborative Discussion and meeting notes
Notes from various meetings, as well as feedback from team members and tutors.

### Reflections
What exactly have I learnt and how?

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
What skills have I gained or enhanced as a result of this module and how can I use it? What else do I need to learn?
