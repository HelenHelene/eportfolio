# Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code

In this unit, we focused on the application of design patterns to effectively structure code. We explored the factory design pattern and its implementation in software development. Additionally, we acknowledged that multiple design patterns can be used in conjunction within a single codebase. We recognized that certain design patterns are more compatible and commonly used together.

Key topics covered in this unit included:
 - Examining the factory design pattern and understanding how it can be applied to generate objects in Python programs.
 - Recognizing that multiple design patterns can be applied simultaneously to support a cohesive code development.
 - Describing the design patterns that are more likely to be used together within a single code package, considering their compatibility and practicality.

### Learning Outcomes
By the completion of this unit, I have achieved the following learning outcomes:
 - Developed a Python program that applies the factory design pattern to effectively generate objects, demonstrating a practical understanding of its implementation.
 - Discussed the concept of using multiple design patterns in conjunction to support a unified code development, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability they provide.
 - Described the design patterns that naturally complement each other and are commonly used together within a single code package, establishing connections between different patterns.
   
### Artefacts
Throughout the unit, I continued to work on my e-portfolio, collecting evidence of my work and showcasing my understanding of the module's concepts and topics.

### Reflections
I have gained a deeper understanding of the practical application of design patterns to structure code. By implementing the factory design pattern in a Python program, I have witnessed firsthand how it enhances object generation and contributes to code organization and flexibility.

Furthermore, I have recognized the power of using multiple design patterns together to create a robust and cohesive codebase. This awareness allows me to consider the relationships between different patterns and leverage their combined benefits to address complex software development challenges.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
I have gained and enhanced skills in designing and implementing code structures using design patterns. This knowledge will be valuable in my future software development endeavors, enabling me to architect scalable and maintainable solutions.

Moving forward, I will continue to explore and expand my knowledge of different design patterns, understanding their unique characteristics and appropriate use cases. Additionally, I will seek opportunities to apply multiple design patterns together, considering their compatibility and synergy to create more efficient and comprehensive code packages.
