# Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI

## Requirement
Read [Correa et al. (2023)](RMPP_Unit01_Read_Correa.pdf) and [Deckard (2023)](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/what-are-ethics-in-ai/).

From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and there is no field of activity that has not been impacted in some way. This is so much truer for Computer Science, which is where it all began. It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is nothing new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field after the ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been slow but constant, today there is the need of a different set of rules.

In the Correa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that “a lot of work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.”

After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with the generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think could be a suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature (additional links to industry have been provided as ‘Other Resources’ to the module). Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.

The word count is 1,000 for the reflection piece. You will have to include this in your e-portfolio, but you can submit it to your tutor for formative feedback before Week 12.

## Assessment Information: Choosing the topic for your literature review and presentation
The topic of your literature review can only be selected from the pre-determined list of topics areas provided. Please see the list of topic areas and start to think which area you would like to investigate. Your literature review is due in unit 2 and you can submit an outline for the review in Unit 4. This outline submission will receive formative feedback only, to help you in your final submission. You can use the same topic for your research proposal presentation, due in unit 10. You can also submit an outline of the presentation in Unit 8, for formative feedback only.

If you are on the MSc stream, you can use the topic of your capstone project for your research proposal. A few points to note:
 - Your literature review cannot be on the same topic as your capstone project. Reusing substantive sections of your own work will be considered as self-plagiarism, which is an academic offence. Hence, your literature review would need to be substantially different to that you will be developing/using in the Project module/Dissertation submission.
 - In the Project module, you will have to create a formal research proposal to be reviewed by your project supervisors (formative but compulsory). This is to ensure that your project is viable and meets the specified criteria for your chosen area of research. The assessment in this module cannot capture the requirements of a proposal submission in its entirety. However, it will provide a valuable starting point for your research proposal submission in the Project module.
