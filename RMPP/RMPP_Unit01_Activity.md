# Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI

## Requirement
Read [Correa et al. (2023)](RMPP_Unit01_Read_Correa.pdf) and [Deckard (2023)](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/what-are-ethics-in-ai/).

From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and there is no field of activity that has not been impacted in some way. This is so much truer for Computer Science, which is where it all began. It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is nothing new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field after the ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been slow but constant, today there is the need of a different set of rules.

In the Correa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that “a lot of work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.”

After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with the generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think could be a suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature (additional links to industry have been provided as ‘Other Resources’ to the module). Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.

The word count is 1,000 for the reflection piece. You will have to include this in your e-portfolio, but you can submit it to your tutor for formative feedback before Week 12.
