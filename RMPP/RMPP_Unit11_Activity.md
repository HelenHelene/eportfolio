### Professional Skills Matrix
Below are the ways to ensure my professional development:

1. The [Matrix](RMPP_Unit11_Matrix.pdf) helps to ensure the required skills are being developed and provides evidence of that development.
2. The [Action Plan](RMPP_Unit11_ActionPlan.pdf) serves as a reminder at the end of the programme.
3. The [SWOT Analysis](RMPP_Unit11_SWOTAnalysis.pdf) helps in completing the matrix and developing an action plan.

## Reflections
The matrix provides a clear framework for identifying key competencies at Masterâ€™s level. It highlights my growing ability to construct well-structured arguments, as evidenced by positive feedback from my presentations in the SEPM, SSD, and RMPP modules.

The SWOT analysis revealed my reliance on bullet points in assignments, highlighting the need to improve my academic writing. Moreover, I set clear objectives in my Action Plan, focusing on qualitative research methods and structured narration. I have also allocated extra time to refine my paragraphs, ensuring alignment with the goals outlined in my Action Plan for enhanced academic coherence.
