# e-Portfolio Preparation


## Requirement
For this week’s seminar, you will need to review the Professional Skills Matrix which is based on BCS guidelines for Masters programmes and the Essex graduate attributes (see the e-Portfolio guide).

 - Compare the content to what has been covered so far in your modules.
 - Insert items you feel should be included in the list (some of these might even be based on personal accomplishments or related to your current employment).
 - Start gathering evidence from this module, as well as previous modules, which will substantiate your skill level.
 - Based on this, complete the SWOT analysis to help with your creation of an Action Plan.
 - Reviewing your degree programme as a whole, reflect on one module in particular that has impacted/will impact your professional practice. Use any reflection format described in the “Reflective Piece” section of the e-Portfolio guide.

During the seminar, we will walk through these documents and you will receive formative feedback on your work.
