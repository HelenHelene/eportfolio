# e-Portfolio Preparation

## Requirement
Review the Professional Skills Matrix which is based on BCS guidelines for Masters programmes and the Essex graduate attributes (see the [e-Portfolio guide](https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=397323&chapterid=4270)).

 - Compare the content to what has been covered so far in your modules.
 - Insert items you feel should be included in the list (some of these might even be based on personal accomplishments or related to your current employment).
 - Start gathering evidence from this module, as well as previous modules, which will substantiate your skill level.
 - Based on this, complete the SWOT analysis to help with your creation of an Action Plan.
 - Reviewing your degree programme as a whole, reflect on one module in particular that has impacted/will impact your professional practice. Use any reflection format described in the “Reflective Piece” section of the e-Portfolio guide.

### Professional Skills Matrix
Below are the ways to ensure my professional development:

1. The [Matrix](RMPP_Unit11_Matrix.pdf) helps to ensure the required skills are being developed and provides evidence of that development.
2. The [Action Plan](RMPP_Unit11_ActionPlan.pdf) serves as a reminder at the end of your programme.
3. The [SWOT Analysis](RMPP_Unit11_SWOTAnalysis.pdf) helps in completing the matrix and developing an action plan.
