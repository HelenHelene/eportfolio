### Professional Skills Matrix
Below are the ways to ensure my professional development:

1. The [Matrix](RMPP_Unit11_Matrix.pdf) helps to ensure the required skills are being developed and provides evidence of that development.
2. The [Action Plan](RMPP_Unit11_ActionPlan.pdf) serves as a reminder at the end of the programme.
3. The [SWOT Analysis](RMPP_Unit11_SWOTAnalysis.pdf) helps in completing the matrix and developing an action plan.

## Reflections
The matrix offers a clear framework for identifying the key competencies expected at Masterâ€™s level. For instance, it highlights my growing ability to construct well-structured arguments in both written and oral forms, as demonstrated by my presentations in the Software Engineering Project Management (SEPM) and Secure Software Development (SSD) modules. This insight has prompted me to incorporate additional experiences from my professional life, such as my background in data protection compliance and the drafting of company policies, to illustrate a broader range of skills.

The SWOT analysis was particularly revealing in showing that I rely too heavily on bullet points in my assignments, indicating the need to develop deeper and more coherent academic writing. Consequently, I set out clear objectives in my Action Plan regarding qualitative research methods and structured narration. The plan itself underscores the value of incremental progress over attempting everything at once. As a practical step, I have scheduled online research methods workshops and allocated additional time to refine my paragraphs, as described in the Action Plan.

Of all the modules I have taken, Research Methods and Professional Practice (RMPP) stands out the most in terms of its influence on my professional growth, especially in relation to codes of conduct and data privacy regulations. Examining frameworks such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the British Computer Society (BCS), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and The Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) has broadened my understanding of how legal and ethical requirements intersect with technological solutions.

This insight has been invaluable in my workplace, where I frequently advise on data handling policies. By applying the reflective tasks from RMPP to real-life scenarios, I have learnt how to align best practices with broader organisational goals. Looking ahead, I plan to keep refining these skills, guided by the milestones in my Action Plan, so that my professional practice remains ethically sound and academically rigorous.
