# Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

Unit 6 introduced quantitative methods, focusing on the use of descriptive statistics to summarise and analyse numerical data. Quantitative methods involve examining relationships between variables, where data is measured numerically and organised into datasets. These datasets consist of variables (columns) and observations (rows), with each cell containing the value of a variable for a specific observation.

Key Concepts:
1. Levels of Measurement:
   - Understanding the different levels of data measurement (e.g., nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio) is crucial for selecting the appropriate statistical methods.

2. Descriptive Statistics:
   - Measures of Location: Summarise data by identifying a "typical" observation through measures such as the mean, median, or mode.
   - Measures of Spread: Provide insight into the variability or dispersion of data using tools like range, variance, and standard deviation.

3. Graphical Summaries:
   - Graphical methods such as histograms, bar charts, and box plots were briefly introduced as ways to visually summarise data. These will be explored further in Unit 8.

The unit emphasised how descriptive statistics can provide a meaningful summary of data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends. Furthermore, the importance of choosing valid methodologies based on the level of measurement of each variable was highlighted.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this week, we will be able to:
 - Understand and apply descriptive statistics.
 - Identify the different levels of measurement.
 - Produce measures of location and spread.

### Artefacts 
In the Deadline Details, a formative task titled "e-Portfolio Update: Data Collection Methods" is mentioned, but I cannot find it in Unit 6.


### Reflections
This unit significantly enhanced my understanding of quantitative methods and how to summarise data effectively. I now have a clearer grasp of how descriptive statistics can simplify complex datasets by providing concise measures of location (e.g., the mean) and spread (e.g., standard deviation). These tools are invaluable for identifying trends and variability within data, which are critical for making informed decisions in research and business contexts.

The introduction to levels of measurement was particularly insightful, as it clarified how data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) dictate the appropriate statistical techniques. This knowledge will ensure I apply the correct methods when analysing data in future projects.

This unit provided a strong foundation for exploring more advanced statistical techniques and data visualisation in future units.
