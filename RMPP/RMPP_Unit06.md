# Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

Welcome to Week 6 where we will introduce quantitative methods.

As a general definition, quantitative methods examine relationships between variables, which are measured numerically and analysed through a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, at times even involving experimental design.

The unity of analysis here are data, which consist of the observed values of one or more variables of interest. They are usually organised into data sets. A data set can be thought of as a table, whose columns represent the different variables, and whose rows represent the individual observations. Each individual cell in the table contains the value that the variable takes for the given observation.

In order to extract meaningful and useful business intelligence from data, it is important that the methodology to be employed is valid for the variable or variables of interest. The first important distinction concerns the level of measurement of each variable.

When exploring data, it is helpful to try to summarise the data in some meaningful way. This is what descriptive statistics is about, which represents the focus of this unit.

One approach is to construct a graphical summary. In this section, we (very briefly) explore some of the more useful graphical summaries, although it is Unit 8 that will deal more specifically with data visualisation.

It is often convenient to summarise numerical data using a few simple summary measures. Most commonly, two such measures are used. The first of these is a measure of location, and represents the value taken by “a typical observation” – that is, by an observation that falls “right in the middle of the data”. As well as knowing the magnitude of a typical observation, some idea of the “variability” or “spread” of the data is also useful. This is provided by a measure of dispersion.

This week we shall:
 - Understand quantitative methods.
 - Define the different levels of quantitative data.
 - Define measures of location and spread.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this week, you will be able to:
 - Understand and apply descriptive statistics.
 - Identify the different levels of measurement.
 - Produce measures of location and spread.
