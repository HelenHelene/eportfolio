### Reflections

In my initial Collaborative Discussion post, I addressed Abi’s challenge of presenting findings that reveal health risks while managing the manufacturer’s expectations. Peer feedback highlighted transparency, integrity, and accountability as key values. We discussed strategies such as independent auditing, consulting domain experts, and adhering to professional guidelines like the BCS Code of Conduct. This reinforced the importance of collaboration between researchers and authorities to uphold ethics while maintaining stakeholder trust.

Although I couldn’t access the lab for the Power BI trial, my professional experience with Power BI enabled me to complete the “Check Your Knowledge” quiz with ease. This confirmed my ability to create dashboards and analyse data effectively to present business insights.
