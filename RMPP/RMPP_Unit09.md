# Unit 9: Validity and Generalisability in Research

Welcome to Week 9 where you will be looking at validity, generalisability and reliability. These are three important dimensions within research as they affect any conclusions you can make after your data collection and analysis. All these need to be considered before you collect any data.

You will then look at the differences in qualitative data and quantitative data and what you can do with it: how to analyse your data and how to present your results should be considered before you collect any data. Note that quantitative data leads us into descriptive and inferential statistics. Before this, however, there are processes of data cleansing and validation that need to be considered.

While related, reliability and validity are two distinct concepts. Reliability refers to the consistency of the measurement process. Validity, on the other hand, focuses on whether the measurement has the correct target, and it is a far broader, and complex, concept. Of course, a measurement process needs to be reliable before its validity can be even assessed.

The lecturecast of this unit will discuss these important points.

In this unit we shall:
 - Introduce the concepts of validity, generalisability and reliability and how they impact on your research design.
 - Consider the differences between qualitative and quantitative data and how to analyse and present your results.
 - 
On completion of this unit Lecturecast, you will be able to:
 - Understand how the concepts of validity, generalisability and reliability affect your investigation and the design of your research method
 - Consider how to analyse and present the results you obtain from your investigation and how they will enable you to answer your research question

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Understand how the concepts of validity, generalisability and reliability affect your investigation and the design of your research method.
 - Consider how to analyse and present the results you obtain from your investigation and how they will enable you to answer your research question.
