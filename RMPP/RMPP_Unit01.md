# Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing

Unit 1 provided a foundational understanding of research methods and the ethical considerations required in computing.

The unit also underscored the importance of ethics in research, with a focus on the Menlo Report's principles of respect, beneficence, justice, and adherence to laws and public interest. These principles ensure that research is conducted responsibly, particularly when it involves human participants or sensitive data.

Additionally, the unit addressed ethical challenges in the age of generative AI, raising concerns about data privacy, transparency, fairness, and accountability due to the rapid advancement of AI technologies.

### Learning Outcomes
The learning outcomes for the unit were to:
 - Differentiate between inductive (starting with specific observations and developing a broader theory) and deductive (starting with a general theory and moving to specific observations) reasoning.
 - Understand the significance of ethics in research and professional practice.


### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct-Initial post](RMPP_Unit01_Initial.pdf)

[Reflective Activity 1 - Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI](RMPP_Unit01_Activity.md)

[Reasoning Quiz](RMPP_Unit01_Quiz.pdf) 


### Reflections
The reflective activity on ethics in computing, particularly focusing on generative AI, was a thought-provoking experience that deepened my understanding of the ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies. Through this activity, I explored multiple perspectives on AI governance, data privacy, and fairness.

Moving forward, I will actively contribute feedback to peers in the collaborative discussion on ethics and professional conduct, using insights gained from this unit to provide constructive and evidence-based responses.
