# Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing

Unit 1 provided a foundational understanding of research methods and the ethical considerations required in computing.

The unit covered the principles of the scientific method, emphasising observation, hypothesis formulation, reasoning, and testing. It introduced two key approaches to reasoning:
 - **Deductive Reasoning:** Starting with a general theory and moving to specific observations.
 - **Inductive Reasoning:** Starting with specific observations and developing a broader theory.

The unit also underscored the importance of ethics in research, with a focus on the Menlo Report's principles of respect, beneficence, justice, and adherence to laws and public interest. These principles ensure that research is conducted responsibly, particularly when it involves human participants or sensitive data.

Additionally, the unit addressed ethical challenges in the age of generative AI, raising concerns about data privacy, transparency, fairness, and accountability due to the rapid advancement of AI technologies.


### Learning Outcomes
The learning outcomes for the unit were to:
 - Differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning.
 - Understand the significance of ethics in research and professional practice.


### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct-Initial post](RMPP_Unit01_Initial.pdf)

[Reflective Activity 1 - Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI](RMPP_Unit01_Activity.md)

[Reasoning Quiz](RMPP_Unit01_Quiz.pdf) 


### Reflections
The reflective activity on ethics in computing, particularly focusing on generative AI, was a thought-provoking experience that deepened my understanding of the ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies. Through this activity, I explored multiple perspectives on AI governance, data privacy, and fairness.

Generative AI, such as large language models, has transformed industries by enabling new forms of creativity and problem-solving. While these advancements are exciting, they also come with significant ethical concerns. For example, generative AI can inadvertently perpetuate biases in datasets, produce misleading information, or violate individual privacy. I learned that frameworks like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Hong Kong’s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) aim to address these challenges, but they often struggle to keep pace with the speed of AI development.

Reflecting on this, I realised the critical role of computer scientists in designing systems that prioritise fairness, accountability, and transparency. This activity also highlighted the growing need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science, law, and social sciences to address the societal impacts of AI technologies.

Moving forward, I have selected “Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in Hong Kong” as my literature review topic. My next steps are to:
1. Gather academic articles and credible sources to prepare a detailed outline.
2. Actively contribute feedback to peers in the collaborative discussion on ethics and professional conduct, using insights gained from this unit to provide constructive and evidence-based responses.
