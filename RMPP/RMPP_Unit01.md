# Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing

### Learning Outcomes
 - Differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning.
 - Understand the significance of ethics in research and professional practice.


### Artefacts
 - [Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct-Initial post](RMPP_Unit01_Initial.pdf)

 - [Reflective Activity 1 - Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI](RMPP_Unit01_Activity.md)

### Reflections
The reflective activity on ethics in generative AI was a thought-provoking experience that deepened my understanding of the ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies. Through this activity, I explored multiple perspectives on AI governance, data privacy, and fairness.

Moving forward, I will actively contribute feedback to peers in the collaborative discussion on ethics and professional conduct, using insights gained from this unit to provide constructive and evidence-based responses.
