# Research Proposal Review

## Requirement
Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project.
Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations will be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in unit 10.

## Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
### Conclusive (Descriptive) Research
Adopting a descriptive approach would help verify existing insights on the financial consequences of cyberattacks. This aligns well with quantitative data collection, particularly for determining how much incidents cost organisations and to what extent they affect operations.

### Exploratory Perspectives
Some exploratory elements may also be valuable, as ransomware and malware threats continue to evolve. This could help uncover new or less documented risks and inform more targeted research questions.

## Which data collection methods would you consider using?
### Secondary Research
Incorporating existing materials from the Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team (HKCERT), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and academic databases.
Analysing case studies, annual reports, and industry surveys to pinpoint direct and indirect cost patterns.

### Surveys and Questionnaires
Building quantitative measures on the frequency of attacks, financial losses, and the range of defensive techniques.

### Interviews
Gathering qualitative insights from cybersecurity specialists or financial controllers about the decision-making process, ethical considerations (such as paying ransoms), and the overall impact of attacks on business continuity.

Combining these methods within a mixed methods approach (quantitative + qualitative) may enhance the depth and reliability of the findings on financial penalties and organisational resilience.

## Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?
### Data Analysis and Statistical Competence
Ability to handle and interpret cost figures, as well as apply statistical tools (e.g. Excel, SPSS, or R) to evaluate trends in cyberattack-related expenses.

### Survey and Interview Design
Skills in crafting clear, targeted questions, especially when examining financial impact and organisational practices related to cybersecurity.

### Literature Synthesis
Capacity to identify themes and link differing research perspectives, highlighting gaps or conflicting evidence.

### Cybersecurity Foundations
Familiarity with ransomware and malware mechanisms, enabling more precise appraisal of technical issues and financial risks.

## Reflections
Engaging in this Q&A exercise clarified the reasoning behind selecting appropriate research methods and data collection techniques for the upcoming research proposal. It highlighted how exploratory and descriptive research designs can complement each other, ensuring that the project thoroughly investigates both measurable financial losses and deeper, context-specific insights. In addition, the process underscored which skills—such as data analysis, survey design, and interview techniques—require development. Overall, this exercise provides a structured foundation, guiding decision-making on methodology, scope, and focus.
