# Research Proposal Review

## Requirement
Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:

 - Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
 - Which data collection methods would you consider using?
 - Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?

Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations will be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in unit 10.
