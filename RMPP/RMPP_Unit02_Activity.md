# Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines


## Requirement
Start planning your literature review based on your chosen topic from the list provided in unit 1. Your outline of the literature review can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 4 before final submission in unit 7. You can use the guidance document for the outline submission, and to prepare your review.

You should also take some time to consider your research proposal which could be based around the area you have chosen to investigate in your literature review or the topic of your capstone project (MSc students). Your outline of the proposal can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 8 before final submission in unit 10. Units 8 and 9 will be focussed on analysing data which, along with research methods, will also need to be considered in your presentation.

## Topic
Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in Hong Kong.

## [Guiding questions to support planning, revising, and refining of a literature review](RMPP_Unit02_GuideQuestion.pdf)
### What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?
**Focus/Aim:** Your review explores the short- and long-term financial implications of ransomware and malware attacks on organisations in Hong Kong.
**Audience:** Primary recipients include academic researchers, lecturers, cybersecurity professionals, and risk managers who need a comprehensive understanding of financial risks associated with cyber threats in the region.

### Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?
Hong Kong’s role as a major economic centre in Asia makes organisations there particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks with high-stakes financial ramifications. By examining both direct and indirect losses, the review intends to shape policy decisions, resource allocation, and to bolster cybersecurity practices at both institutional and governmental levels.
   
### What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?
**Context:** Hong Kong’s digitally advanced and globally linked financial systems create an environment susceptible to ransomware and malware.
**Perspective:** Socio-economic perspective, recognizing that financial repercussions extend beyond immediate ransom or system repairs to include reputational damage, potential regulatory fines, and operational disruptions.

**Analytical Framework:** A thematic approach (covering direct costs, indirect costs, mitigation strategies, and ongoing debates) synthesizes a range of sources, allowing a multi-faceted understanding of financial impacts.

### How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?
**Source Location:** Sources are drawn from academic databases (UoE Library, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar) and critical Hong Kong-specific organisations like the Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team (HKCERT) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
**Selection Criteria:** Emphasis on recent studies (past decade) for current threat landscapes and empirical evidence or explicit cost data to understand real-world impacts.

### How is your review structured?
**Introduction:** Explains rationale and aims.
**Context and Scope:** Discusses Hong Kong’s digital environment and regulations.
**Direct Financial Impacts:** Focuses on ransom payments, restoration costs, and legal liabilities.
**Indirect Financial Consequences:** Explores reputational damage, cyber insurance costs, and staff training requirements.
**Mitigation Measures:** Highlights security frameworks, continuity planning, and cyber insurance.
**Critical Perspectives:** Addresses debates regarding ransom payments and heavy reliance on insurance.
**Methodological Approaches:** Assesses research designs and their constraints.
**Gaps and Future Directions:** Identifies underexplored SMEs’ challenges and suggests longitudinal studies.
**Conclusion:** Summarizes main findings and proposes further explorations/policy strategies.

### What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?
**Key Findings:** 
 - Direct financial losses include negotiation costs, system restoration, and legal liabilities.
 - Indirect losses encompass reputational harm, operational downtime, elevated cyber insurance premiums, and possible regulatory penalties.
 - Mitigation strategies (including continuity planning and technical solutions) are vital to contain financial fallout.
 - Ongoing debates highlight ethical concerns around paying ransoms, as well as the effectiveness and cost of reliance on cyber insurance.
    
### What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature?
**Strengths:**
 - Increasing empirical evidence offers nuanced insights into the financial toll of ransomware and malware on Hong Kong organisations.
 - Studies highlight context-specific data that tie technical disruptions to broader business implications.
**Limitations:**
 - Underreporting due to corporate reputation fears hinders comprehensive data collection.
 - Lack of consistent longitudinal studies limits the assessment of evolving threats over time.

### Are there any discrepancies in this literature?
As this review is in its early stages, I currently lack sufficient evidence to identify clear discrepancies in the literature.

### What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an 
Owing to the limited scope of this preliminary investigation, I cannot yet draw firm conclusions or propose detailed recommendations.
