# Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines


## Requirement
Start planning your literature review based on your chosen topic from the list provided in unit 1. Your outline of the literature review can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 4 before final submission in unit 7. You can use the guidance document for the outline submission, and to prepare your review.

You should also take some time to consider your research proposal which could be based around the area you have chosen to investigate in your literature review or the topic of your capstone project (MSc students). Your outline of the proposal can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 8 before final submission in unit 10. Units 8 and 9 will be focussed on analysing data which, along with research methods, will also need to be considered in your presentation.
