# Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines


## Requirement
Start planning your literature review based on your chosen topic from the list provided in unit 1. Your outline of the literature review can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 4 before final submission in unit 7. You can use the guidance document for the outline submission, and to prepare your review.

You should also take some time to consider your research proposal which could be based around the area you have chosen to investigate in your literature review or the topic of your capstone project (MSc students). Your outline of the proposal can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 8 before final submission in unit 10. Units 8 and 9 will be focussed on analysing data which, along with research methods, will also need to be considered in your presentation.

## Topic
Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in Hong Kong.

## [Guiding questions to support planning, revising, and refining of a literature review](RMPP_Unit02_GuideQuestion.pdf)
### What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?
 - The review aims to investigate the short- and long-term financial implications of ransomware and malware on organisations in Hong Kong.
 - Target groups include academic researchers, lecturers, cybersecurity professionals, and risk managers seeking insights into local cyber threats.

### Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?
 - Hong Kong’s status as a major economic hub in Asia underscores the urgency of understanding the financial repercussions of cyberattacks.
 - By examining direct and indirect losses, the review intends to guide policy decisions, resource allocation, and cybersecurity strategies at institutional and governmental levels.
   
### What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?
 - **Context:** Hong Kong’s advanced and globally connected financial systems create an environment highly susceptible to ransomware and malware.
 - **Perspective:** A socio-economic lens recognises that financial consequences extend beyond ransom payments and repairs, affecting reputation, regulatory compliance, and operational continuity.
 - **Analytical Framework:** A thematic approach covers direct costs, indirect costs, mitigation strategies, and current debates, providing a multi-faceted understanding of financial impacts.

### How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?
 - **Source Location:** Key databases include the UoE Library, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Hong Kong-specific organisations such as HKCERT and HKMA.
 - **Selection Criteria:** Preference is given to recent studies (past decade) featuring empirical evidence and explicit cost data to reflect contemporary threat landscapes.


### How is your review structured?
**1. Introduction:** Highlights rationale and overarching aims.
**2. Context and Scope:** Details Hong Kong’s digital landscape and related regulations.
**3. Direct Financial Impacts:** Examines expenditures for ransom, restoration efforts, and legal liabilities.
**3. Indirect Financial Consequences:** Addresses reputational damage, increased insurance costs, and staff training.
**4. Mitigation Measures:** Assesses security frameworks, continuity planning, and cyber insurance considerations.
**5. Critical Perspectives:** Explores debates on ransom payments and heavy reliance on insurance solutions.
**6. Methodological Approaches:** Evaluates research designs represented in the existing literature.
**7. Gaps and Future Directions:** Identifies underexplored challenges for SMEs and calls for longitudinal research.
**8. Conclusion:** Summarises principal findings and puts forward suggestions for further investigation and policy development.

### What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?
 - **Ethical Debates:** Ongoing controversies regarding ransom payments and reliance on cyber insurance.
    
### What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature?
 - **Strengths:** Increasing empirical evidence offers nuanced insights into the financial toll of ransomware and malware on Hong Kong organisations.
 - **Limitations:** Underreporting due to corporate reputation fears hinders comprehensive data collection.
 - Lack of consistent longitudinal studies limits the assessment of evolving threats over time.

### Are there any discrepancies in this literature?
 - The review remains at an early stage and lacks sufficiently detailed evidence to pinpoint clear inconsistencies in reported findings.

### What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an 
 - Due to the preliminary scope, no definitive conclusions or comprehensive policy recommendations can yet be drawn.

## Reflections
This Q&A offers a clear framework for beginning a literature review on the financial impact of ransomware and malware in Hong Kong. It defines the focus, aims, rationale, audience, and analytical approach, ensuring that the research remains anchored to key themes such as direct and indirect costs, mitigation strategies, and emerging debates. By highlighting how to locate and select sources, structure the review, and examine both strengths and limitations in existing studies, the Q&A directs the researcher toward gathering robust evidence. The next logical step is to draft a concise literature review outline for tutor feedback, which will refine the scope and methodology before proceeding with a deeper investigation.
