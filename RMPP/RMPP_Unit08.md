# Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualisation

Unit 8 focused on data analysis and visualisation, shifting attention from the research methods covered in earlier units to working with and presenting collected data. This unit explored the differences in analysing qualitative and quantitative data, as well as the importance of presenting findings clearly and effectively through visualisation techniques.

Key concepts included:
1. Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data Analysis:
    - Qualitative data, consisting of observations, images, and words, is often subjective and requires coding to categorise responses for analysis.
    - Quantitative data involves distinct stages of preparation and analysis, with descriptive and inferential statistics providing clear structure.

2. Coding and Software for Qualitative Data:
    - Coding is essential for organising unstructured qualitative responses. Software is often used to streamline the process and ensure efficient analysis.

3. Data Visualisation and Dashboards:
    - In an era of Business Intelligence, dashboards are widely used to present actionable insights by connecting data to key performance indicators (KPIs).
    - Visualisation tools such as charts and graphs allow researchers to communicate findings effectively, making complex data accessible to a wider audience.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of the unit, students gained the ability to:
 - Analyse both qualitative and quantitative data using appropriate methods.
 - Select suitable charts and graphs to present findings clearly and effectively.
 - Identify the key components and functions of dashboards to extract meaningful insights.

### Artefacts 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

Collaborative Discussion 2 - Case Study on Accuracy of Information-Respond to peers: [Respond 1](RMPP_Unit08_Respond1.pdf) , [Respond 2](RMPP_Unit08_Respond2.pdf) & [Respond 3](RMPP_Unit08_Respond3.pdf)

### Reflections
This unit required the continuation of the Whizzz cereal case study in the collaborative discussion, which allowed us to further explore the balance between ethical concerns and business interests. I was encouraged to see that many peers shared a strong commitment to maintaining ethical professionalism. The discussions highlighted the importance of finding ways to protect our professions and uphold integrity, even when faced with commercial pressures. This reinforced my belief that fostering ethical standards in the workplace is essential for long-term success and trust.

After resolving the worksheet issues in Unit 7 and following the provided examples, the inference exercises in this unit were much more straightforward. The practice enhanced my analysis and interpretation skills in inferential statistics and their application to real-world data.

Completing the research proposal outline was a challenging but rewarding task. It required me to decide on a topic distinct from my Capstone project and Literature Review while ensuring relevance to my research interests. Although it was difficult to finalise the topic, the process of creating this outline helped me refine my ideas and conduct a preliminary thematic literature search.

Fortunately, I discovered a substantial body of existing work on my chosen topic, which allowed me to explore it from a unique perspective. However, I realised that the topic lacked sufficient depth for a full Capstone project, so I eliminated it from my list of potential ideas. This decision enabled me to narrow my focus and prioritise more suitable topics for future research.

The tutorâ€™s feedback provided valuable guidance on structuring a research proposal and helped me improve my academic writing and citation practices. I now feel more confident about developing and presenting my research ideas effectively.

Engaging in discussions and completing the research proposal outline during this unit helped me develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I now have a better understanding of how to approach research topics strategically and present insights in a way that aligns with ethical and professional standards.
