### Reflections
_(Word count: 110)_ <br>
This unit involved continuing the Whizzz cereal case study in a collaborative discussion, exploring the balance between ethical concerns and business interests. It was encouraging to see many peers committed to ethical professionalism. The discussions underscored the importance of protecting integrity and fostering ethical standards for long-term success and trust.

Completing the research proposal outline was challenging but rewarding. I had to choose a topic distinct from my Capstone project and Literature Review while ensuring it aligned with my research interests. This process helped refine my ideas and conduct a preliminary literature search.

The tutorâ€™s feedback improved my academic writing, citation skills, and confidence in developing and presenting research ideas.
