### Reflections
The inferential statistics workshop and worksheet were both engaging and challenging. As an accountant, I had studied statistics during my degree and master's programme, but I have rarely applied this knowledge in practice. This workshop allowed me to revisit concepts that felt familiar yet long-neglected. The workshop demonstrated how tools like Excel simplify the process of obtaining results, enabling us to focus on analysing and interpreting data rather than performing complex calculations.

However, the worksheet presented some initial confusion, as errors in the material caused difficulties for many participants. While some reported the issue, the errors were not resolved during the session. I took the initiative to cross-check and amend the worksheet, sharing the corrected version with my peers. This collaborative effort helped those struggling with the exercise and highlighted the value of teamwork in overcoming challenges.

This workshop enhanced my understanding of inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, both of which are invaluable for making data-driven decisions in research and professional contexts.
