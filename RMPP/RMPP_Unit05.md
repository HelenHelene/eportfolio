# Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design

### Learning Outcomes
 - Understand the difference between a good questionnaire and a poor one, and how to obtain the responses we will need for our investigation.
 - Design a questionnaire to obtain the responses we will need for our investigation.

### Artefacts 
 - [Reflective Activity 2 - Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys](RMPP_Unit05_Activity.md) 

 - [Wiki Activity - Questionnaires](RMPP_Unit05_Wiki.md) (Not attempted)


### Reflections
The Cambridge Analytica case study highlighted the ethical challenges of data collection, emphasising transparency, informed consent, and compliance with regulations like GDPR. It showed how the misuse of surveys can lead to serious ethical and social consequences.
This unit improved my understanding of designing effective questionnaires and selecting suitable research methods. 
For my capstone project, I will ensure that any surveys or questionnaires I design adhere to ethical standards and data protection regulations, applying the knowledge gained to both my dissertation and future projects.
