# Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design

This unit focused on interviews, survey methods, and questionnaire design as essential tools for collecting data in research. The unit highlighted their applications in both qualitative and quantitative research, emphasising the importance of understanding these methods to design effective investigations.

Key concepts were discussed in this unit, including:

1. **Interviews:** A common qualitative research method conducted one-on-one, which allows for in-depth exploration of individual perspectives, behaviours, and experiences.
2. **Surveys:** A widely used quantitative method for collecting data, often via online platforms for easier accessibility, usually used to explore trends, opinions, and behaviours within a specific population.
3. **Questionnaires:** A set of structured questions used within a survey to gather specific data, offering flexibility and able to be conducted online, over the phone, or face-to-face.  Questionnaires can include both open-ended and closed-ended questions, depending on the research needs.
4. **Pre- and Post-Testing:** Methods used to measure changes before and after implementing a new process or system, offering a "before-and-after" perspective.

The unit also introduced the cyclic nature of the survey process, from questionnaire design to survey distribution, data collection, and analysis. It stressed the importance of designing good questionnaires to ensure relevant and high-quality responses.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, we will be able to:
 - Understand the difference between a good questionnaire and a poor one, and how to obtain the responses we will need for our investigation.
 - Understand how interviews and surveys fit into research and whether either or both of these might be useful for our investigation.
 - Understand how pre- and post-testing can be used in research.
 - Design a questionnaire to obtain the responses we will need for our investigation.
 - Understand how the data obtained can be analysed.

### Artefacts 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities, which are documented in the provided link:

[Wiki Activity - Questionnaires](RMPP_Unit05_Wiki.md) (Not attempted)


### Reflections
From this unit, I gained a deeper understanding of how interviews, surveys, and questionnaires can be used effectively in research. I learned the distinction between surveys and questionnaires, as well as the importance of designing clear, relevant, and ethically sound questions to ensure reliable data collection.

The Cambridge Analytica case study served as a powerful reminder of the ethical challenges associated with data collection. It emphasised the importance of transparency, informed consent, and compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR. This case highlighted how the misuse of surveys and questionnaires can have far-reaching consequences, both ethically and socially.

After this unit, I now understand how to design effective questionnaires and choose appropriate methods for my research objectives. This unit also enhanced my ethical awareness and deepened my understanding of the importance of informed consent, data protection, and transparency in research. The knowledge gained will be directly applicable when designing surveys for my dissertation and future projects.

For the surveys or questionnaires I will design for my capstone project, I will ensure that they comply with ethical standards and data protection regulations.
