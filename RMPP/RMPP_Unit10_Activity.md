# Statistical Worksheet Submissions


## Requirement
You can submit your analyses from Units 8 and 9 for formative feedback if you wish.

You must, however, submit both analyses and associated documentation as part of the final e-Portfolio submission in Unit 12. Failure to include the completed analyses in your final e-Portfolio will have severe implications on your grade for this assessment, and in turn, your final module grade.
