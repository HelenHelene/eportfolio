## Reflections
This submission covering Units 7 to 9, required us to progressively develop our skills. In Unit 7, we practised following instructions, applying these in Unit 8 exercises, and further exploring visualisation techniques in Unit 9, with all work to be submitted in Unit 10.

Beyond statistical skills, this series reinforced the importance of managing tasks efficiently and completing them promptly, even if they seem less important initially. Postponing tasks, especially formative or foundational ones, risks delaying the entire project or disrupting the plan. This process effectively trains us to stay on schedule, a crucial skill in project management.
