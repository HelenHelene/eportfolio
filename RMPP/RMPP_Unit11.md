### Reflections
_(Word count: 98)_ <br>
This unit has provided valuable tools for my academic and professional development, including the Professional Skills Matrix, SWOT analysis, and Action Plan. These have helped me identify my strengths and areas for improvement, emphasising the importance of incremental progress. By focusing on manageable steps rather than overwhelming tasks, I now have a clear guide for completing the e-portfolio.

Looking ahead, I plan to use the milestones in my Action Plan to refine my skills further, ensuring my professional growth aligns with both academic principles and industry demands. This structured approach will support my ongoing development and future success.
