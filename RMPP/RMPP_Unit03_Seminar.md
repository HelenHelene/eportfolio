### Critical Review of Two Papers:
**Paper 1 (Castro et al., 2020):** 
Castro, J.H., Cartwright, A. & Cartwright, E. (2020) An economic analysis of ransomware and its welfare consequences, _Royal Society Open Science_ 7(7): 190023. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190023.

**Paper 2 (Krivokapic et al., 2023):** 
Krivokapic, D., Nikolic, A., Stefanovic, A. & Milosavljevic, M. (2023) Financial, Accounting and Tax Implications of Ransomware Attack, _Studia Iuridica Lublinensia_ 32(1): 191–211. DOI: 10.17951/sil.2023.32.1.191-211.

### 1. Research Purpose, Problem, and Objectives
**Paper 1 (Castro et al., 2020):** 
In the first paper, the authors examine the economic impact of ransomware and investigate how different strategies used by cybercriminals (such as pricing and discrimination) affect both their profits and the welfare costs to society. The paper’s central question appears to focus on how ransomware attacks evolve economically, highlighting the ransom-setting strategies and their broader societal implications. 

**Paper 2 (Krivokapic et al., 2023):**  
In the second paper, the authors aim to clarify the financial, accounting, and taxation implications of ransomware attacks. They dive into how organisations can recognise these costs, either as deductions or as expenses, and what legal constraints (e.g., taxation and accounting rules) apply to such payments. 

Both papers strongly reinforce the notion that ransomware incurs multi-faceted impacts: technical, legal, and economic, and contribute valuable insight to the current literature on malware research and cybercrime economics.

### 2. Research Methodology Used and Its Appropriateness
**Paper 1 (Castro et al., 2020):** 
This paper primarily employs a theoretical and analytical economic model, integrating standard monopoly pricing theories with empirical survey data about individuals’ willingness to pay. The authors interpret the data via economic modelling (e.g., demand functions and elasticity) to assess how cybercriminals might adjust their ransom strategies.

The use of an economic model with real-world survey data is suitable for understanding profit maximisation and pricing strategies. As the main question revolves around the interplay of criminals’ economic incentives and societal welfare, a theoretical economic framework underpinned by partial empirical data seems highly relevant.

**Paper 2 (Krivokapic et al., 2023):**  
This paper utilises a formal-dogmatic legal method alongside scoping review. The researchers systematically analyse legal documents and tax/accounting frameworks relevant to ransomware. By interpreting laws, rules, and regulatory directives, they explain how organisations can approach the cost of ransomware payments from an accounting perspective.

Given that the focus is on the legal, accounting, and tax implications, the formal-dogmatic approach (i.e., examining relevant legislation and legal norms) is well-suited. The scoping review further supports a thorough understanding of how existing scholarship and legal frameworks approach ransomware payments.
In both instances, the chosen research methodologies are fitting for the respective research questions.

### 3. Data Collection and Analysis
**Paper 1 (Castro et al., 2020):** 
The authors rely partly on survey data to estimate individuals’ willingness to pay for file recovery. They then feed this into their economic model (e.g., demand function) to derive insights on ransom-setting. The combination of quantitative data (survey figures) and theoretical economic modelling is consistent with their objective to measure potential societal loss and criminals’ profit margins.

**Paper 2 (Krivokapic et al., 2023):**  
The study focuses on document analysis (statutes, regulations, accounting rules) and literature-based arguments to formulate a framework for how ransomware payments might be recognised in financial statements. Since the team is not primarily testing a hypothesis but rather reviewing, interpreting, and synthesising existing legal provisions, relying on textual legal sources and official commentaries is apt for their research aim.

In both papers, data collection (legal documents or survey-based evidence) and analysis methods align well with each paper’s stated purpose.
<br><br>

### 4. Support for Claims and Conclusions
**Paper 1 (Castro et al., 2020):** 
The authors support most claims about criminals’ pricing strategies with explicit references to monopoly pricing theories and empirical examples of known ransomware incidents. The presence of survey findings about individuals’ willingness to pay adds practical weight.

**Paper 2 (Krivokapic et al., 2023):**  
Each claim regarding deductibility or illegality is referenced against national tax/regulatory frameworks or published legal opinions. Their conclusions appear well supported by case-based reasoning and explicit references to legal code sections (e.g., references to corporate profit tax laws, VAT rules, etc.).

Hence, both papers generally succeed in providing evidence (theoretical, empirical, or legal) to bolster their conclusions.

### 5. Enhancements to the Work
**Paper 1 (Castro et al., 2020):** 
Empirical Testing: Expand the survey sample (e.g., across multiple regions or industries) to reinforce the statistical significance.
Longitudinal Data: Include follow-up surveys over time to see if changing trends in Bitcoin pricing or ransomware style alter the model’s conclusions.

**Paper 2 (Krivokapic et al., 2023):**  
Case Studies: Incorporate real-life organisational case studies illustrating final tax/accounting treatments of ransom payments to present practical scenarios.
Comparative Analysis: Include a brief comparative angle showing how different jurisdictions handle ransomware-related expenses, strengthening the generalisability of findings.

Such enhancements could make both works more robust in their respective disciplines, giving practitioners stronger guidance while amplifying academic contributions.

## Reflections
Through carrying out this assignment, I have developed a sharper awareness of how different research methods, economic modelling, and legal-dogmatic analysis intersect. I also learned how crucial it is to align research objectives with the right methodological tools: a quantitative approach suits inquiries into pricing models and elasticities, while a legal-analytical method is ideal for examining the boundaries of law.

I believe these insights will significantly benefit my upcoming literature review on “Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in Hong Kong,” guiding me to assess existing literature for methodological rigour and recognise that different perspectives can offer unique contributions.
