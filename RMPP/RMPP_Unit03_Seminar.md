# Peer Review Activity


## Requirement
Source at least 2 papers in a Computing subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, or a general interest topic in Computer Science) provided they utilise two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. 
Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:

 - Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?
 - Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?
 - In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)
 - Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?
 - How would you enhance the work/paper?

You can set up your responses as a presentation for the group. Remember to record your answers and feedback in your e-portfolio.
