# Reflective Activity 2 - Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

## Background: The Cambridge Analytica Case
One of the most notable instances of unethical survey use was the Cambridge Analytica incident in 2018 (Confessore, 2018; Rosenberg et al., 2018). This political consultancy firm accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users through a personality quiz app. Although the quiz appeared harmless—much like many social-media surveys—it led to far-reaching consequences:

**1. Data Gathering Method** <br>
Cambridge Analytica relied on a third-party Facebook app (a questionnaire or quiz) that explicitly collected data from users. At the time, Facebook’s developer policies also granted access to participants’ friends’ data—even if those friends themselves did not complete the survey.

**2. Purpose and Improper Use** <br>
The organisation used the information it gathered to build detailed psychographic profiles for targeted political campaigns, including the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit referendum. Most users were unaware of how their data was being collected or that it would be monetised and employed for political objectives.

## Further Examples of Misuse
There are numerous surveys and quizzes that may seem entertaining but are nevertheless used in dubious ways. For instance, certain online quizzes, advertised as psychological tests to discover which celebrity shares a similar personality, often gather data such as a user’s name, birth date, gender, location, and browsing habits. In many cases, they also request access to a user’s friend list, encouraging participants to invite others (Bischoff, 2020; Wakefield, 2015).

## Impact of Inappropriate Use of Surveys
Ethically, problems arise when individuals are not informed about how their data will be used (informed consent), when they are compelled to share personal details without proper clarification—which can compromise their privacy and independence—and when personal data is exploited for targeted advertisements or propaganda, thus influencing decision-making. On a social level, incidents such as Cambridge Analytica’s undermine public confidence in online platforms and may exacerbate social or political divisions by channelling manipulative content to specific groups. Legally, organisations must operate within regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU, 2016), which imposes strict rules on data gathering, consent, and use. Violations can result in legal challenges, substantial fines, and damaged reputations. Professionally, those who develop or distribute surveys must ensure full transparency around their objectives and methods, as well as adhere to ethical principles and legal requirements to maintain trust.

## Conclusion
The Cambridge Analytica case demonstrated how even seemingly benign quizzes can be misused for political or commercial gain. Other examples range from playful quizzes that secretly collect significant amounts of user data to phishing surveys aimed at obtaining sensitive information. From an ethical perspective, these cases highlight issues surrounding informed consent and personal autonomy; socially, they erode confidence and may generate greater socio-political tension; legally, they push the limits of data protection regulations; and from a professional standpoint, they require clear transparency and the highest ethical standards.

## Reflections
From the Cambridge Analytica case, I learned that seemingly harmless surveys can be exploited to gather sensitive personal data. This emphasises the importance of transparency and informed consent: participants should know exactly what data is collected, its purpose, and possible recipients. 

Moving forward, especially when developing surveys for my dissertation, I must comply with data protection guidelines (e.g., GDPR and PDPO) and ethical research protocols. That includes designing clear privacy notices, storing data securely, and limiting collection to what is genuinely required for my research objectives. Doing so helps assure participants and preserves the integrity of my work.
