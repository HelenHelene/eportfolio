# Unit 10: Research Writing

Unit 10 introduced the fundamentals of research writing, a vital skill for effectively communicating technical knowledge. This unit focused on understanding the structure and purpose of research documents, including dissertations, research proposals, and publications.

The unit emphasised that research writing is a key competency for professionals in tech-related fields, especially for those tasked with preparing extensive documents such as dissertations. It highlighted how research writing skills are not only essential for academic success but also beneficial for publishing work in peer-reviewed journals or presenting findings in a professional context.

Key concepts included:

1. Research Reporting/Writing:
   - The importance of clear, structured writing to present research findings effectively.
   - Techniques for organising and developing large documents like dissertations.

2. Dissertation Sections:
   - Detailed guidance on the various sections of a dissertation, such as the introduction, literature review, methodology, results, and conclusion.
   - Tips on how to approach each section systematically to ensure coherence and logical flow.

This unit also brought together the skills developed in earlier units, such as conducting literature reviews, selecting research methods, and analysing data, culminating in the preparation of a project proposal.


### Learning Outcomes
On completing this unit, I have gained:
 - An understanding of how to structure and write a dissertation effectively.
 - Insights into how research writing connects previous stages of research, such as identifying topics, reviewing literature, and choosing methods.
 - The ability to prepare myself for the demands of research writing, both academically and professionally.

### Artefacts 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities, which are documented in the provided link:

[Statistical Worksheet Submissions](RMPP_Unit10_Activity.md)


### Reflections
The submission of statistical worksheets from Units 7 to 9 was a significant e-portfolio activity that ensured tasks were completed on time and helped us stay on track. This process highlighted the importance of effective time management and avoiding procrastination, particularly when working on foundational tasks that influence the later stages of a project.

I found this exercise especially valuable, as it demonstrated how small, incremental steps can contribute to the successful completion of a larger task. It also emphasised the importance of consistently meeting deadlines, which is an essential skill for both academic and professional project management.

Building on the lessons from earlier units, this weekâ€™s focus on research writing has reinforced the importance of integrating all aspects of the research process. From identifying a research topic and conducting a literature review to selecting appropriate methods and analysing data, I have gained a clear understanding of how to approach each section of a dissertation. This has prepared me for the challenges of writing my final project.

Up to this point, I have developed a stronger understanding of how to approach research writing, particularly dissertations. My time management skills have improved through the timely completion of tasks, such as the statistical worksheet submission, and I have gained a deeper appreciation of how to integrate all stages of research into a cohesive final document. Additionally, this unit has strengthened my ability to communicate research findings clearly and effectively, a skill that is equally relevant in both academic and professional contexts.

Looking ahead, I plan to apply these skills to prepare for my dissertation and future research projects. This unit has equipped me with the tools to organise and present my work in a professional and impactful manner, ensuring that my research is both thorough and accessible to its intended audience.
