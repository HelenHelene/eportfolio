### Reflections
_(Word count: 103)_ <br>
Submitting statistical worksheets from Units 7 to 9 was a key e-portfolio activity that ensured timely task completion and kept us on track. This exercise highlighted how small, consistent steps contribute to achieving larger goals and reinforced the importance of meeting deadlines—a crucial skill for academic and professional project management.

This week’s focus on research writing enhanced my understanding of integrating all aspects of the research process. From identifying a topic and conducting a literature review to selecting methods and analysing data, I now feel more prepared to approach each section of my dissertation and tackle the challenges of my final project.
