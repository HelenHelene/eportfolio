# Module 7 Research Methods and Professional Practice

In this module, we explore a practical foundation in research methods that will enable us to conduct research in real-world settings. The module covers a variety of tools and techniques that we may need, and it allows us to receive feedback throughout via case studies and project tasks. Additionally, the module provides valuable insights into the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues relevant to computing projects, as well as the associated codes of practice.

The two core textbooks offer a comprehensive overview of the subject, focusing on the scientific method and detailing how to conduct research in different types of organisations. We are required to engage with the practicalities of research, as well as critically analyse the key principles of research methodology. This will help us integrate the knowledge gained throughout other modules in our programme.

Assessment in this module is continuous, incorporating case studies and milestone tasks. This facilitates peer-to-peer and instructor interactions. We will demonstrate our abilities and strengths by maintaining an e-Portfolio, which will serve as evidence of our work and reflections throughout the module.

This module acts as the starting point for our Capstone Project, ensuring that we are well-prepared before beginning the Project Module. As the tutor mentioned in the seminar, this module is like ‚Äútoe-dipping, testing the water‚Äù on a subject we are interested in. Personally, I often struggle with understanding the specific requirements for the artefact in the Capstone Project. I am particularly interested in creating a framework for risk mitigation rather than developing software. I hope this module will help me find clarity on whether this approach would be acceptable for an MSc project.

There are three assignments in this module. For the first assignment, we need to select a topic from a provided list and perform a literature review. This assignment serves as the foundation for developing the research topic in the next task.

The second assignment requires us to create a research proposal, building upon the literature review but approaching it from a different angle. We will need to outline a research question, methodology, artefact description, and project timeline. Developing a research proposal is an essential skill for starting a research project.

Finally, we are expected to submit an e-Portfolio, compiling evidence of our work and submitting a reflective piece on our personal development throughout the module. This will allow us to track our progress and demonstrate the skills we have gained.
