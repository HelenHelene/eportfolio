# Module 7 Research Methods and Professional Practice

This module serves as the starting point for our Capstone Project, ensuring we are well-prepared before beginning the Project Module. As the tutor mentioned in the seminar, this module is akin to ‚Äútoe-dipping, testing the water‚Äù on a subject we are interested in. Personally, I often struggle with understanding the specific requirements for the artefact in the Capstone Project. I am particularly interested in creating a framework for risk mitigation rather than developing software. I hope this module will help me gain clarity on whether this approach would be acceptable for an MSc project.

There are three assignments in this module, as listed below:

#### Assignment 1 _(üéìPass with Distinction)_
[Literature Review](RMPP_A1.md) <br>
	
#### Assignment 2 _(üéìPass with Distinction)_
[Research Proposal Presentation](RMPP_A2.md)

#### Assignment 3: Individual ePortfolio _(üéìPass with Distinction)_
[Reflective Piece](RMPP_A3.md)
