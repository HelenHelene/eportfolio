# Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations

Unit 4 introduced essential qualitative and quantitative research methods, including case studies, focus groups, and observations, which are key tools in data collection. These methods are primarily used in qualitative research but can also be applied to quantitative studies, depending on the research objectives.

Key Learning Points:
1. Case Studies
   - Provide in-depth insights into individuals or groups.
   - Useful for hypothesis generation and exploring complex phenomena.
   - However, they lack reliability for generalisation due to potential researcher bias and atypical respondents.

2. Focus Groups
   - A qualitative method where a small group of participants (6-10 people) discusses a topic.
   - Effective for answering “why”, “what”, and “how” questions.
   - Success relies on selecting participants with similar backgrounds and experiences.

3. Observations
   - Quantitative Observation: Collects numerical data (e.g., weight, volume) for statistical analysis.
   - Qualitative Observation: Focuses on behavioural patterns and characteristics, often conducted in natural environments.
   - Observation techniques range from being a complete observer to full participation, depending on the research needs.

The unit also highlighted the importance of combining methods to achieve comprehensive results and addressed the strengths and limitations of each approach, helping us understand which method would be most appropriate for specific research contexts.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit we will be able to:
 - Understand how to carry out each of these data collection methods.
 - Know which method would be suitable, if any, for your investigation.
 - Consider the type of data you would obtain.

### Artefacts 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities, which are documented in the provided link:

[Literature Review Outline Submission](RMPP_Unit04_Activity.md) 

### Reflections
This unit gave me a clearer understanding of how to apply different data collection methods in research. I now appreciate the value of case studies for exploring complex issues, focus groups for gathering detailed perspectives, and observations for both qualitative and quantitative insights. The practical examples and discussions helped me understand how to balance the strengths and weaknesses of each method when designing a research study.

The artefacts, particularly the case study on privacy, deepened my awareness of the ethical dilemmas involved in research. I learned how principles like GDPR and Hong Kong’s PDPO protect personal data and how important it is to uphold privacy and consent in the research process. This understanding will be critical as I apply ethical standards to my own academic and professional work.  

I selected the topic "Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in Hong Kong." for my literature review and received feedback from my tutor regarding the outline. Based on the tutor's feedback, I will simplify the structure to focus on three main sections: **Introduction**, **Main Discussion**, and **Conclusion**.

I will practise applying the methods discussed in this unit—such as observations or case studies—to my literature review topic, considering their potential to enrich my findings. Additionally, I will continue developing my ethical awareness to ensure that all future research aligns with data protection laws and ethical guidelines.

Unit 4 has significantly improved my ability to design and conduct research, while also strengthening my understanding of ethical practices in data collection. These skills and insights will undoubtedly benefit my upcoming literature review and future research projects.
