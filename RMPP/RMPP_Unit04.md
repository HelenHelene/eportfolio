# Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations

### Learning Outcomes
 - Understand how to carry out each of data collection methods.
 - Consider the type of data you would obtain.

### Artefacts 
 - [Seminar: Case Study on Privacy](RMPP_Unit04_Seminar.md)

 - [Literature Review Outline Submission](RMPP_Unit04_Activity.md) 

### Reflections
The case study on privacy enhanced my understanding of ethical dilemmas in research, highlighting the importance of principles like GDPR and Hong Kongâ€™s PDPO in ensuring privacy and consent. This knowledge will guide me in applying ethical standards to my academic and professional work.

For my literature review, I chose the topic "Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in Hong Kong." Following my tutor's feedback, I will simplify the structure into three sections: Introduction, Main Discussion, and Conclusion.

I plan to apply methods discussed in this unit, such as case studies, to enrich my findings and strengthen my analysis.
