# Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal

Unit 2 introduced the fundamental components of developing a research proposal. The discussions and activities focused on defining a research question, understanding the structure and purpose of a research proposal, and conducting a literature review.

Key aspects covered in this unit included:
 - Formulating and revising research questions: Students learned how to develop and refine research questions to ensure clarity and focus.
 - Understanding the components of a research proposal: The unit explored all the sections that make up a research proposal and how to present ideas effectively.
 - Explaining the literature review process: Guidance was provided on what a literature review entails, how to perform it, and how to present findings.

By completing this unit, students were expected to develop the following key skills:
 - Identifying suitable research topics and crafting well-defined research questions.
 - Exploring methods to transform research ideas into actionable proposals.
 - Conducting and critiquing literature relevant to their chosen topics.
 - Structuring and presenting a coherent literature review and research proposal.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct-Respond to peers: [Respond 1](RMPP_Unit02_Respond1.pdf), [Respond 2](RMPP_Unit02_Respond2.pdf) & [Respond 3](RMPP_Unit02_Respond3.pdf)

### Reflections
Initially, I felt overwhelmed by the prospect of defining a suitable research question and conducting a literature review, as these tasks seemed abstract and complex. However, the structured approach provided in the lectures and guiding questions made the process more manageable.

Working on the topic of ransomware and malware’s financial impact in Hong Kong was particularly engaging. It allowed me to explore a real-world issue with significant socio-economic implications. I felt motivated to investigate this area further, especially considering Hong Kong’s position as a global financial hub and the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks.

The collaborative discussions were highly insightful, as they encouraged me to critically analyse ethical dilemmas and consider practical solutions to workplace issues. Responding to peers’ posts helped me refine my perspective and learn from diverse viewpoints, enhancing my ability to articulate and support arguments with evidence.

Moving forward, my primary goal is to develop a comprehensive outline of my literature review and research proposal. Overall, Unit 2 has laid a strong foundation for my research journey, equipping me with the tools and confidence to undertake more complex academic tasks. While there is still much to learn, I feel more prepared and optimistic about the process.
