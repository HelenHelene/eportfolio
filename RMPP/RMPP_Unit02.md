# Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal

Welcome to Week 2 where you will be introduced to the various aspects of a research proposal, starting with defining a research question.

Defining the topic of your research may be a tedious process, and one that appears often ‘daunting’ (Boza, 2022), but it is essential to ensure you are successful in your research. You will start with an initial research idea and then ask pertinent questions that may need further revisions before you prepare your research proposal, which is the foundation to your research.

One element of the proposal is a literature review within your chosen area. A literature review is a survey of scholarly sources on a specific topic. It provides an overview of current knowledge, allowing you to identify relevant theories, methods, and gaps in the existing research. In this unit, you will be introduced to the process of completing a literature review and how to present your review. This will be based on a list of topics, from which you will choose one that interests you the most.

On completion of this unit lecturecast you will be able to:
 - Understand the structure and purpose of the research proposal.
 - Consider a suitable research question.
 - Begin a literature review for your chosen area of investigation.

### In this unit we shall:
 - Look at how you formulate and revise research questions.
 - Look at all the parts that make up a research proposal and how to present your thoughts.
 - Explain what a literature review is, how to perform it, and how to present it.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Examine the characteristics that make up a suitable research topic.
 - Explore rational and creative methods for formulating a research idea.
 - Identify means of transforming research ideas into crafted research questions and proposal.
 - Conduct a literature search, critique the literature and to present a literature review.
