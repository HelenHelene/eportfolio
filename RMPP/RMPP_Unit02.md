### Reflections
_(Word count: 100)_ <br>
Initially, I felt overwhelmed by defining a research question and conducting a literature review, as these tasks seemed abstract. However, the structured lectures and guiding questions made the process manageable.

Exploring ransomware’s financial impact in Hong Kong was engaging, given its socio-economic relevance and Hong Kong’s role as a financial hub. Collaborative discussions were insightful, encouraging critical analysis of ethical dilemmas and workplace issues. Responding to peers’ posts helped me refine my perspective and strengthen arguments with evidence.

Overall, Unit 2 has built my confidence and provided tools for tackling complex academic tasks, leaving me more prepared for future challenges.
