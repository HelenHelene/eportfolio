# Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

This unit focused on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, providing a deeper exploration of quantitative methods. The key objective of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions about a larger population based on data collected from a smaller sample. This process allows researchers to identify patterns, relationships, and generalisations while accounting for the inherent variability of data using probability.

Key concepts discussed in this unit include:

1. Inferential Statistics:
    - The process of making predictions or generalisations about a population based on sample data.
    - It enables researchers to derive meaningful insights from raw data.

2. Probability:
    - Introduced as the foundation of statistical inference, quantifying the uncertainty associated with data analysis.

3. Hypothesis Testing:
    - A statistical method used to determine whether an assumption about a population value is likely to be true.
    - It is particularly useful for comparing values across two or more populations.

The unit also highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate probability distributions and hypothesis tests to ensure accurate and valid conclusions.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, we are able to:
 - Apply inferential statistics to data analysis.
 - Identify the correct probability distributions for data.
 - Perform hypothesis tests to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Artefacts 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

[Seminar: Inferential Statistics Workshop and Statistics Worksheet](RMPP_Unit07_Activity.md)


### Reflections
This unit included two important and interesting artefacts.

The collaborative discussion on balancing ethical obligations and commercial interests provided an opportunity to reflect on the challenges professionals face when presenting statistical findings. The Whizzz cereal case study highlighted the potential conflict between ethical transparency and business objectives. It reinforced the importance of integrity in data reporting and adhering to professional codes of conduct, such as the BCS Code of Conduct, to ensure public trust and ethical practice.

As a part-time student with extensive work experience, I recognise how difficult it can be to maintain ethical standards in the business world. For fresh graduates, this challenge can be even greater. This discussion emphasised the need for management teams to foster an ethical professional environment to guide future generations in balancing these competing interests.

The inferential statistics workshop and worksheet were both engaging and challenging. As an accountant, I had studied statistics during my degree and master's programme, but I have rarely applied this knowledge in practice. This unit allowed me to revisit concepts that felt familiar yet long-neglected. The workshop demonstrated how tools like Excel simplify the process of obtaining results, enabling us to focus on analysing and interpreting data rather than performing complex calculations.

However, the worksheet presented some initial confusion, as errors in the material caused difficulties for many participants. While some reported the issue, the errors were not resolved during the session. I took the initiative to cross-check and amend the worksheet, sharing the corrected version with my peers. This collaborative effort helped those struggling with the exercise and highlighted the value of teamwork in overcoming challenges.

This unit enhanced my understanding of inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, both of which are invaluable for making data-driven decisions in research and professional contexts.

The ethical considerations explored in the collaborative discussion reminded me of the importance of transparency and integrity in presenting findings, ensuring data is not misrepresented for commercial gain. These lessons will be directly applicable in my capstone project and future professional endeavours, where I will strive to balance ethical responsibilities with practical business needs.

It also improved my problem-solving and collaborative skills by addressing errors in the worksheet and assisting peers. Moving forward, I will apply these insights to my research and professional work, ensuring that my data analysis is both accurate and ethically sound.
