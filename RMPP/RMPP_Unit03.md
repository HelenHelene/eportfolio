# Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods

This unit focused on the concept of research methodology and provided an overview of various research methods, highlighting their importance in answering research questions. The unit emphasised how a researcher’s assumptions—ontological, epistemological, and axiological—influence the choice of methodology, research design, and data collection techniques.

Key Concepts:
1. Research Design:
   - Exploratory Research: Investigates broad aspects of a research area to gain a better understanding of a problem.
   - Conclusive Research: Focuses on verifying specific insights and is often descriptive in nature.

2. Research Methods:
   - Qualitative: Explores experiences, behaviours, and emotions to answer "how" and "why" questions.
   - Quantitative: Focuses on numerical data and statistical analysis to answer "how much" or "to what extent" questions.
   - Mixed Methods: Combines qualitative and quantitative approaches for a holistic understanding.

3. Data Collection Methods:
   - Primary Research: Information gathered directly from participants (e.g., surveys, interviews).
   - Secondary Research: Analyses existing literature, case studies, and published materials.

This unit helped me understand the importance of aligning research questions with appropriate methods and provided insights into how research designs and data collection techniques contribute to robust findings.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit we will be able to:
 - Understand the different research methods.
 - Know which data collection methods are related to each method of research.
 - Have some idea which of these would be suited to your area of research.
