# Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods

This unit focused on the concept of research methodology and provided an overview of various research methods, highlighting their importance in answering research questions. The unit emphasised how a researcher’s assumptions—ontological, epistemological, and axiological—influence the choice of methodology, research design, and data collection techniques.

Key Concepts:
1. Research Design:
   - Exploratory Research: Investigates broad aspects of a research area to gain a better understanding of a problem.
   - Conclusive Research: Focuses on verifying specific insights and is often descriptive in nature.

2. Research Methods:
   - Qualitative: Explores experiences, behaviours, and emotions to answer "how" and "why" questions.
   - Quantitative: Focuses on numerical data and statistical analysis to answer "how much" or "to what extent" questions.
   - Mixed Methods: Combines qualitative and quantitative approaches for a holistic understanding.

3. Data Collection Methods:
   - Primary Research: Information gathered directly from participants (e.g., surveys, interviews).
   - Secondary Research: Analyses existing literature, case studies, and published materials.

This unit helped me understand the importance of aligning research questions with appropriate methods and provided insights into how research designs and data collection techniques contribute to robust findings.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit we will be able to:
 - Understand the different research methods.
 - Know which data collection methods are related to each method of research.
 - Have some idea which of these would be suited to your area of research.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are recorded in the link below:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct-Summary post](RMPP_Unit03_Summary.pdf)

[Research Proposal Review](RMPP_Unit03_Activity.md) 

[Seminar: Peer Review Activity](RMPP_Unit03_Seminar.md)

### Reflections
Through the unit and artefacts, I deepened my understanding of the different research methods and their applicability. I now recognise the value of exploratory research in generating new ideas and descriptive research in verifying specific insights. Moreover, I learned the significance of combining qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a more comprehensive analysis, especially for complex topics like cybersecurity.

The artefacts, particularly the Collaborative Discussion on codes of ethics, reinforced the importance of ethical considerations in research. I gained insights into how professional conduct and ethical frameworks, such as the ACM and BCS codes, play a critical role in safeguarding workplace integrity and research credibility.

The Research Proposal Review activity was particularly helpful in clarifying how to apply research methods to my chosen topic. It enabled me to see the potential of using secondary research to analyse existing data, while also incorporating surveys and questionnaires for primary research. This dual approach will enrich my findings and provide both depth and reliability.

Lastly, the Peer Review Activity strengthened my ability to evaluate research papers critically, focusing on the alignment between research objectives, methodologies, and conclusions. This skill will be invaluable for my upcoming literature review.


Moving forward, I will focus on improving my statistical and data analysis skills, as these are crucial for handling quantitative data. Additionally, I will practise designing effective surveys and identifying relevant secondary sources.  These skills will not only strengthen my ability to conduct my literature review but will also benefit my future academic and professional projects.
