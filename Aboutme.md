## About Me

I am a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with a Masterâ€™s degree in Management Science - Accounting, currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science. 
This academic journey has strengthened my expertise in computational theory, programming paradigms, data protection, and strategies for safeguarding organizational information assets. 
My capstone project, planned for completion by late 2025, focuses on developing data strategies that balance compliance with innovation.  

As the Head of Finance and IT Operations and serving as the organization's Data Protection Officer and IT Security Officer, I leverage the synergy between finance and technology to address complex challenges at their intersection. 
My role involves designing policies and frameworks to enhance cybersecurity, ensure compliance with data protection regulations, and safeguard sensitive information.  

By integrating my accounting background with advanced computer science knowledge, I strive to drive innovation in IT operations, enhancing efficiency across financial and operational processes. Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to contribute to strengthening organizational technological resilience, supporting strategic growth in the ever-evolving landscape of finance and technology.
