## About Me

I am a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with a Master's degree in Management Science - Accounting. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by pursuing an MSc in Computer Science, which I anticipate completing by 2025. This academic pursuit enriches my role as the Head of Finance and IT Operations, where I also serve as the Data Protection Officer and IT Security Officer. The fusion of finance and technology in my career reflects my commitment to staying at the forefront of industry developments and addressing the complex challenges at the intersection of these fields.

My journey in computer science has been both rigorous and rewarding. I have successfully completed modules in Launching in Computer Science, Object-Oriented Programming, Network Security, Information Security Management, and Software Engineering Project Management. These courses have established a robust foundation in computational theory, programming paradigms, data protection, and strategies for safeguarding organizational information assets. The remaining modules—Secure Software Development and Research Methods and Professional Practice—are enhancing my capability to develop secure applications and conduct professional research, skills that directly apply to my responsibilities in IT operations and data protection.

In my professional capacity, I apply the insights from my studies to formulate strategies, comprehensive policies, and frameworks aimed at strengthening our organization's cybersecurity posture. I am responsible for implementing robust measures that ensure compliance with data protection regulations and safeguard sensitive data. By leveraging advancements in technology, I plan to drive innovation within IT operations, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness across financial and operational processes.

Integrating my accounting expertise with advanced computer science knowledge uniquely positions me to navigate the challenges at the nexus of finance and technology. My goal is to fortify the technological resilience of my organization and contribute meaningfully to the development of secure, innovative systems. As I progress toward completing my MSc in Computer Science, I remain committed to fostering an environment that prioritizes security, innovation, and strategic growth in the ever-evolving landscape of finance and information technology.
