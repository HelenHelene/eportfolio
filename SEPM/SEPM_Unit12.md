# Unit 12: The Case for the Future Direction of Software Engineering Project Management

In the last unit, we will evaluate future trends and build a case for which one will become the predominant driver for the future direction of Software Engineering Project Management. We will review a number of future trends, both introduced in Unit 11 and in this unit, and create and debate a presentation about which trends will be dominant.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit I will be able to explain why the selected trend is the main driver for future developments.

### Artefacts 
Throughout the unit, I continued to work on my e-portfolio, collecting evidence of my work and showcasing my understanding of the moduleâ€™s concepts and topics.

### Reflections
In Unit 12, I evaluated various future trends in software engineering project management and built a case for which trend will likely dominate. This process involved reviewing trends from previous units and debating their potential impact. It reinforced the importance of critical analysis and strategic thinking in anticipating future developments in the field.

### Action Plan
I plan to stay informed about emerging trends and continuously refine my analytical skills. I will engage in discussions and debates to better understand different perspectives and update my e-portfolio with insights and evidence of my strategic thinking. 
This approach will help me effectively anticipate and adapt to future developments in software engineering project management.
