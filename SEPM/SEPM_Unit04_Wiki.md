# Wiki Entry: Risks and risk mitigation

After reading the two articles by [Verner et al (2014)](SEPM_Unit04_Reading1.pdf) and [Anton & Nucu (2020)](SEPM_Unit04_Reading2.pdf), let's address the following questions:

## 1. What are the main risks that the authors identify? How do these fit into the traditional SDLC model?

### Global Software Development (GSD) Risks:
 - Communication issues due to cultural and language differences.
 - Coordination challenges across different time zones.
 - Vendor selection problems affecting project management and technical capabilities.
 - These risks fit into the SDLC during various phases:
     - **Requirement Analysis:** Miscommunication can lead to unclear requirements.
     - **Design and Development:** Coordination issues may delay development.
     - **Testing:** Vendor selection problems can affect quality assurance.
      
### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Risks:
  - Financial distress and associated costs.
  - Low earnings performance and growth opportunities.
  - These risks fit more into the initial planning and ongoing assessment stages of the SDLC, as they influence overall project feasibility and resource allocation.

## 2. Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 lecturecast would you use to capture and categorise the risks?
I would use the NIST Risk Management Framework as it provides a comprehensive approach to managing risks with a focus on continuous monitoring and improvement. It is well-suited for both technical and organizational risks identified in software development and enterprise contexts.

## 3. Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module wiki.
**Risk:** Misalignment between vendor and client expectations.<br>
**Mitigation:** Establish clear communication channels and regular check-ins to ensure alignment. Use detailed contracts and service level agreements (SLAs) to set expectations.


## Reflections
From this exercise, I've learned the importance of understanding various risk factors and how they fit into the broader context of project management and development life cycles. Using frameworks like NIST helps in systematically addressing and mitigating these risks, ensuring better project outcomes. The collaborative aspect of adding to a wiki and reviewing peers' entries enhances learning through shared insights and practical solutions.
