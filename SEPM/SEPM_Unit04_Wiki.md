# Wiki Entry: Risks and risk mitigation

After reading the two articles by [Verner et al (2014)](SEPM_Unit04_Reading1.pdf) and [Anton & Nucu (2020)](SEPM_Unit04_Reading2.pdf), let's address the following questions:


1. What are the main risks that the authors identify? How do these fit into the traditional SDLC model?
2. Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 lecturecast would you use to capture and categorise the risks?
3. Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module wiki.
4. Choose an entry made by one of your colleagues in the wiki and comment on how you might mitigate it.

## Reflections
From this exercise, I've learned the importance of understanding various risk factors and how they fit into the broader context of project management and development life cycles. Using frameworks like NIST helps in systematically addressing and mitigating these risks, ensuring better project outcomes. The collaborative aspect of adding to a wiki and reviewing peers' entries enhances learning through shared insights and practical solutions.
