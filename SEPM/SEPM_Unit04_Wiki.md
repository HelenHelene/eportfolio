# Wiki Entry: Risks and risk mitigation

## Introduction
Read the articles by [Verner et al (2014)](SEPM_Unit04_Reading1.pdf) and [Anton & Nucu (2020)](SEPM_Unit04_Reading2.pdf) and then answer the following questions:
1. What are the main risks that the authors identify? How do these fit into the traditional SDLC model?
2. Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 lecturecast would you use to capture and categorise the risks?
3. Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module wiki.
4. Choose an entry made by one of your colleagues in the wiki and comment on how you might mitigate it.
