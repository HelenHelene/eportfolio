# Unit 7: Software Development Life Cycles

Welcome to Week 7, where we will examine the role that is played by software development life cycles (SDLC) in influencing the way in which a project is managed, considering, more specifically, the waterfall and agile approaches to project management. We will then look at the specific tasks involved in each stage of a life cycle in more detail, highlighting the ways in which the Project Manager supports the activities involved. 

In this unit we shall:
 - Examine the importance of managing a project so that the triple constraints of project management are balanced against one another.
 - Gain an appreciation of the variety of non-functional requirements. 
 - Investigate a selection of mistakes which are made during software engineering projects.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Describe the activities that are carried out by a Project Manager at each stage of the SDLC. 
 - Collect the requirements of a software engineering project using the Volere template.
 - Define a behaviour-driven development scenario.
