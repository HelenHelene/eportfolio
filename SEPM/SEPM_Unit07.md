# Unit 7: Software Development Life Cycles

In this unit, we will explore how software development life cycles (SDLC) influence project management, focusing on waterfall and agile approaches. We'll examine the tasks in each life cycle stage and how the Project Manager supports these activities.

We will:
 - Understand how to balance the triple constraints of project management.
 - Appreciate various non-functional requirements.
 - Investigate common mistakes in software engineering projects.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Describe the Project Managerâ€™s activities at each SDLC stage.. 
 - Gather project requirements using the Volere template.
 - Define a behavior-driven development scenario.
