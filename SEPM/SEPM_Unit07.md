# Unit 7: Software Development Life Cycles

In this unit, we will explore how software development life cycles (SDLC) influence project management, focusing on waterfall and agile approaches. We'll examine the tasks in each life cycle stage and how the Project Manager supports these activities.

We will:
 - Understand how to balance the triple constraints of project management.
 - Appreciate various non-functional requirements.
 - Investigate common mistakes in software engineering projects.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Describe the Project Managerâ€™s activities at each SDLC stage.. 
 - Gather project requirements using the Volere template.
 - Define a behavior-driven development scenario.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

Collaborative Discussion 2 - Factors Affecting User Experience-Respond to peers: [Respond 1](SEPM_Unit07_Respond1.pdf) & [Respond 2](SEPM_Unit07_Respond2.pdf)

[Collaborative Discussion 2 - Factors Affecting User Experience-Summary Post](SEPM_Unit07_Summary.pdf)

[Emotional reactions](SEPM_Unit07_Activity.md)

### Reflections
In Unit 7, I explored the influence of software development life cycles (SDLC), particularly the waterfall and agile approaches, on project management. Through the collaborative discussions and artefacts, I gained insights into balancing the triple constraints of project management and understanding various non-functional requirements. Engaging with the Components of User Experience (CUE) model highlighted how emotional reactions are shaped by usability and aesthetics. This deepened my appreciation for a holistic approach to user experience that considers both functional and emotional aspects. The inclusion of peer post expanded my perspective on integrating security and user backgrounds into UX models.

### Action Plan
Moving forward, I will apply these insights by ensuring that project plans incorporate both functional and emotional user requirements. I plan to integrate regular usability testing and user feedback into the development process to enhance user satisfaction. Additionally, I will focus on improving communication channels to manage emotional reactions effectively. By adopting a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to UX design, I aim to enhance overall user satisfaction and project success.
