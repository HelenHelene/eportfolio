# e-Portfolio activity: Emotional reactions

## Introduction
In relation to the ‘Components of User Experience’ model from [Van der Linden et al., (2019)](SEPM_Unit07_Reading.pdf) (below), consider the ‘Emotional reactions’ of user experience.


## Description of image
On the highest level, system properties, user characteristic and context parameters feed into human-technology interaction. 
In the CUE-model, the core aspects of the user experience are summarised in three distinct components: the Perceived instrumental qualities, the Perceived non-instrumental qualities and the Emotional reactions. 
These three make up User experience consequences: overall judgments, usage behaviour and choice between alternatives.
