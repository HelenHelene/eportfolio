# e-Portfolio activity: Emotional reactions

## Introduction
This activity request us refer to the ‘Components of User Experience’ model from [Van der Linden et al., (2019)](SEPM_Unit07_Reading.pdf) (below), consider the ‘Emotional reactions’ of user experience.

## Description of image
On the highest level, system properties, user characteristic and context parameters feed into human-technology interaction. <br>
In the CUE-model, the core aspects of the user experience are summarised in three distinct components: 
1. Perceived instrumental qualities
2. Emotional reactions
2. Perceived non-instrumental qualities <br>

These three make up user experience consequences: overall judgments, usage behaviour and choice between alternatives.

## Question
As a Project Manager, what might be your response to manage the emotional reactions of a customer? 
You should use at least three academic papers to support your response and write a minimum of 300 words as your response.

## Answer
Managing the emotional reactions of a customer is crucial for ensuring a positive user experience. According to the CUE model by Van der Linden et al. (2019), emotional reactions are influenced by both perceived instrumental qualities (such as usefulness and ease of use) and perceived non-instrumental qualities (including aesthetic, symbolic, and motivational aspects). Here are strategies to manage these reactions, supported by academic literature:

### 1. Enhance Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use:<br>
The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) highlights perceived usefulness and ease of use as key factors influencing user acceptance (Davis, 1989). By ensuring the product is genuinely useful and easy to navigate, users are more likely to have positive emotional reactions. Regular usability testing and user feedback can help identify areas for improvement.

### 2. Focus on Aesthetic and Symbolic Aspects:<br>
The aesthetics of a product can significantly impact user satisfaction and emotional responses (Tractinsky et al., 2000). A well-designed interface that aligns with user expectations and cultural symbols can enhance emotional engagement. This involves not just visual design but also how the product aligns with the user’s self-image and values.

### 3. Address Emotional Reactions Directly:<br>
Emotional reactions encompass subjective feelings and cognitive appraisals (Norman, 2004). It is essential to understand and address these reactions through empathetic communication and support. Providing responsive customer service and clear communication channels can help manage negative emotions and reinforce positive experiences.

By integrating these strategies, project managers can effectively manage customer emotional reactions, leading to improved user satisfaction and loyalty.

## Reflections
This activity deepened my understanding of the complex interplay between different components of user experience. The CUE model highlights that emotional reactions are not isolated but are influenced by a range of factors, including both the practical and emotional aspects of technology use. Reflecting on this, I realize the importance of a holistic approach to user experience design, one that considers not only functional requirements but also emotional and aesthetic needs. This understanding will be valuable in future projects where user satisfaction is a critical success factor.
