# Module 5 Software Engineering Project Management

In this module, we explore what it means to be a Project Manager in software engineering. We examine the relationships between the Project Manager and stakeholders, ensuring the triple constraints of project management are balanced without accruing technical debt. From a practical perspective, we consider how to respond to customer needs using test-driven and behavior-driven development. We identify and apply appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques for developing solutions to real-world problems.

We explore the implications of computer and network architectures for system-level design, focusing on risk and quality management. We design, develop, and evaluate management systems to handle constraints and uncertainties, incorporating BDD concepts and secure coding practices. Students systematically develop skills to be effective team members in a virtual environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organization.

There are three assignments in this module. In the first assignment, we participate in the team submission and individual peer assessment. For the team submission, we need to develop a proposal detailing a suitable development methodology, requirements, development plan, milestones, deliverables, and estimated costs.

The second assignment requires students to present to stakeholders, providing a status update, plan, and budget to address challenges from the first assignment.

Lastly, we are expected to submit an e-Portfolio, gathering evidence of work and submitting a reflective piece on personal development throughout the module.
