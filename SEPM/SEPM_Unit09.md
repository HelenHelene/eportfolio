# Unit 9: Quality Management Strategy

Welcome to Week 9. This week is important as it will help you to appreciate the range of ways through which software quality may be determined to have been achieved. When testing a software development and preparing for delivery of the software to the client, there will be a need to demonstrate that the functional and non-functional requirements of the system have been fulfilled. 

In this unit we shall:
 - Examine the reasons for which effective quality management of a software development is important.
 - Explore a variety of metrics by which software quality may be measured.
 - Recognise the important roles to be played by quality management planning, control and assurance when working to provision a high-quality software product. 

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Write a set of non-functional requirements by which a software development may be tested to demonstrate that quality has been achieved.
 - Appreciate the ways in which technical debt may be accrued through ineffective software quality management.

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activity to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

### Reflections
In Unit 9, I learned the significance of effective quality management in software development. Understanding how to measure software quality using various metrics and ensuring that both functional and non-functional requirements are met is crucial. The role of quality management in planning, control, and assurance is essential for delivering high-quality software. This unit highlighted the impact of technical debt due to poor quality management and the importance of maintaining code quality through strategies like adhering to PEP 8 standards, using tools like black, and documenting code thoroughly.

### Action Plan
My action plan for Unit 9 involves deepening my understanding of quality management by regularly writing and reviewing non-functional requirements to ensure comprehensive testing. I'll study and apply different quality metrics to assess software quality effectively. I'll also implement quality management strategies in personal projects, focusing on planning, control, and assurance. By concentrating on these areas, I aim to enhance my skills in quality management and consistently deliver high-quality software products.
