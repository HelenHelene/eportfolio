# Unit 9: Quality Management Strategy

In this unit, we will examine why effective quality management in software development is essential. We will explore various metrics for measuring software quality and recognize the crucial roles of quality management planning, control, and assurance in delivering a high-quality software product. Understanding these concepts will help us appreciate the different ways to determine software quality.

When testing software and preparing for client delivery, it is necessary to demonstrate that both functional and non-functional requirements have been met.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, we will be able to:
 - Write a set of non-functional requirements to test and demonstrate software quality.
 - Appreciate how technical debt can accumulate through ineffective software quality management.

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activity to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

### Reflections
In Unit 9, I learned the importance of effective quality management in software development. Measuring software quality and meeting both functional and non-functional requirements are crucial. Quality management in planning, control, and assurance helps deliver high-quality software. The unit emphasized avoiding technical debt and maintaining code quality through PEP 8 standards, using tools like black, and thorough documentation. These practices improve code readability, maintainability, and team collaboration. Consistently applying these techniques will help me produce more efficient and professional code in future projects.

### Action Plan
My action plan for Unit 9 involves deepening my understanding of quality management by regularly writing and reviewing non-functional requirements to ensure comprehensive testing. I'll study and apply different quality metrics to assess software quality effectively. I'll also implement quality management strategies in personal projects, focusing on planning, control, and assurance. By concentrating on these areas, I aim to enhance my skills in quality management and consistently deliver high-quality software products.
