# Unit 11: Software Engineering Project Management: Future Trends

This week we will review a number of emerging and innovative trends in project management, software engineering, computer science and IT, and discuss how these trends may affect SEPM and drive future directions. 

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit I will be able to:
 - Present a case that promotes one of the future trends as the main factor that will drive the future direction of SEPM.

### Artefacts 
Throughout the unit, I continued to work on my e-portfolio, collecting evidence of my work and showcasing my understanding of the moduleâ€™s concepts and topics.

### Reflections
In Unit 11, I explored various emerging trends in project management, software engineering, computer science, and IT that could shape the future of the discipline. Understanding these trends highlighted their potential impact on SEPM and how they might drive future directions. This exploration emphasized the importance of staying informed and adaptable in a rapidly evolving field.

### Action Plan
I plan to continuously research and follow the latest trends in project management and software engineering. I will engage with professional communities by participating in forums and attending conferences to learn about upcoming innovations. Additionally, I'll focus on acquiring skills related to new technologies and methodologies, and update my e-portfolio with projects that demonstrate my understanding and application of these trends.
