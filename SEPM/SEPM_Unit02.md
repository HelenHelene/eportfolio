# Unit 2: Study: Why Projects Fail and Gathering Requirements Exercise

This unit covers important aspects of project managementâ€”namely, why projects fail and how to elicit requirements and implement them effectively. 
We will read several articles about large projects failing, investigate the reasons for failure, and discuss suitable mitigations. 
We also have the chance to practice requirement gathering using the Gherkin tool.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Suggest mitigations for common project failures.
 - Carry out requirements gathering using Gherkin.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:
