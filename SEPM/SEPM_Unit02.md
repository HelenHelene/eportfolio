# Unit 2: Study: Why Projects Fail and Gathering Requirements Exercise

This unit covers important aspects of project managementâ€”namely, why projects fail and how to elicit requirements and implement them effectively. 
We will read several articles about large projects failing, investigate the reasons for failure, and discuss suitable mitigations. 
We also have the chance to practice requirement gathering using the Gherkin tool.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Suggest mitigations for common project failures.
 - Carry out requirements gathering using Gherkin.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

Collaborative Discussion 1 - Project Failures Study-Respond to peers: [Respond 1](SEPM_Unit02_Respond1.pdf) & [Respond 2](SEPM_Unit02_Respond2.pdf)

[Requirements Gathering](SEPM_Unit02_Seminar.md)

### Reflections
In this unit, I explored the reasons why projects fail, focusing on common pitfalls such as unclear objectives, inadequate communication, and scope creep. By analyzing case studies, I gained insights into how these issues can be mitigated through effective planning and stakeholder engagement.

Moreover, using the Gherkin tool allowed me to practice structuring requirements in a clear, testable format. The "Given-When-Then" syntax helped in creating concise scenarios that reflect user needs and expectations.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
To enhance my project management skills, I plan to apply the Gherkin skills I learned in this unit to the upcoming team project. I will also explore tools like Trello and stay updated on best practices by subscribing to relevant journals and participating in online forums. This approach will help me effectively contribute to successful project outcomes.
