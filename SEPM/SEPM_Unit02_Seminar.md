# Exercise: Security Standards

### Introduction
This exercise is reading the [Behaviour Driven Development (2020) pages](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/philosophy.html#the-gherkin-language) and then use the Gherkin language to create a Gherkin sequence that addresses ONE of the following examples:
 - Using a new coffee making machine.
 - Interfacing with a new SatNav system.
 - Using a computer running the Linux operating system.
 - Getting familiar with a new vehicle.
 - Creating a batch or shell script.

The response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as administrator, user, driver and so on.  

### Getting familiar with a new vehicle
**Scenario:** Driver starts the vehicle
    **Given** the driver has the vehicle key
    **When** the driver inserts the key into the ignition
    And turns the key
    **Then** the vehicle should start

  **Scenario: Passenger adjusts the seat**
    **Given** the passenger is seated in the vehicle
    **When** the passenger uses the seat adjustment controls
    **Then** the seat should move to the desired position

  **Scenario: Administrator sets up the vehicle's infotainment system**
    **Given** the administrator has access to the vehicle
    **When** the administrator accesses the infotainment settings
    And connects the system to the internet
    **Then** the infotainment system should be updated with the latest software
