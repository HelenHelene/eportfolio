# Exercise: Security Standards

## Introduction
This exercise is reading the [Behaviour Driven Development (2020) pages](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/philosophy.html#the-gherkin-language) and then use the Gherkin language to create a Gherkin sequence that addresses ONE of the following examples:
 - Using a new coffee making machine.
 - Interfacing with a new SatNav system.
 - Using a computer running the Linux operating system.
 - Getting familiar with a new vehicle.
 - Creating a batch or shell script.

The response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as administrator, user, driver and so on.  

## Getting familiar with a new vehicle
**Scenario:** Driver starts the vehicle <br>
    **Given** the driver has the vehicle key <br>
    **When** the driver inserts the key into the ignition <br>
    And turns the key <br>
    **Then** the vehicle should start <br>

  **Scenario: Passenger adjusts the seat** <br>
    **Given** the passenger is seated in the vehicle <br>
    **When** the passenger uses the seat adjustment controls <br>
    **Then** the seat should move to the desired position <br>

  **Scenario: Administrator upgrades the vehicle's auto drive system** <br>
    **Given** the administrator has access to the vehicle <br>
    **When** the administrator accesses the auto drive settings <br>
    And connects the system to the internet <br>
    **Then** the auto drive system should be updated with the latest software <br>

  
## Reflections
This Gherkin language reminds me of Pseudocode from one of the assignments in the first module, Launching into Computer Science. Itâ€™s an easy way to get stakeholders involved during requirement gathering.
