### [Assignment 2: Development Individual Project: Presentation](SEPM_A2_Intro.pdf)

<br>

**Due:** Monday, 14 October 2024, 11:55 PM

In this unit, the focus is on the second objective/deliverable, the presentation. This assignment must be submitted by end of unit 11. This accounts for 40% of your final module mark.

### Assignment Brief
Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a presentation of your response to the EDC challenges (see [part 2, chapter 5 of the case study](SEPM_A1_CaseStudy.pdf) and [Appendix 1](SEPM_A1_Appendix1.pdf) & [Appendix 2](SEPM_A1_Appendix2.pdf)).

This submission should consist of a presentation to the major stakeholders that consists of a status/progress update and a plan and budget showing what changes are required to mitigate the challenges mentioned above, and how these will impact progress from design through to implementation and ultimately UAT. You should assume (as per your original plan) that a number of devices have already been produced.

### Presentation
The presentation should consist of a PowerPoint deck of up to 10 slides that describes the project milestones, summarises plans and sprints, covers the status of the project and contains a plan (and budget) to get to final implementation. 

**Please ensure that your citations and list of references are included in the slides and citations mentioned in your transcript.**

### Checklist
Each deliverable for this assessment is mentioned below and is equally distributed across 3 grading criteria (see Module Resources for the full list):

1. Create a table that lists the updated requirements that will be met by the modified systems, with justifications for why they were selected. State the assumptions you need to make to be able to design the project plan.

2. Create a fully costed project plan for the updated system you have designed - this plan should detail the components and cost price of a modified system and when the new prototypes will be ready. Bear in mind that marketing department have already advertised systems at the price of £399.99. Discuss whether you will make two systems (one for Synful, one for EDC, or have one system used by both companies but sold under different names/badges. How will you accommodate the different requirements from EDC, existing users and potential new users?) (Knowledge and Understanding, 25%)

3. Create and deliver a Presentation that addresses EDC’s complaints and explains how they will be mitigated – including explaining when the new systems will be available, what they will cost and any deviations from expectations (Application of Knowledge, 25% and Criticality, 25%).

4. Ensure that you produce a business ready proposal, that is well structured with no typographical errors. It should present your recommendations in a clear and easy to read format. It should have been proofread before it is submitted (Structure and Presentation, 15%)

5. Finally, ensure your justifications for any decisions made are based on good academic principles and that any academic sources you have used/referred to are clearly cited and that your references are presented in the required UoEO format. (Academic Integrity, 10%)

### Instructions
For this assignment, you are required to record a **20-minute presentation**, along with a **transcript** of the audio file. The presentation should include your demonstration. Your slides should not be wordy or repeat, verbatim, the oral presentation. Visuals, illustration, statistics, charts, tables and indication of key pointers are welcome. In assessing the presentation for marking, emphasis will be place on the oral content. However, clarity of the visual presentation will also be taken into account.

It is strongly recommended that, in order to record your presentation, you use a headset with a microphone.

There is no word count for the slide presentation, and there is no fixed word count for the oral presentation/transcript. However, note that an average speech rate for a comfortable and clearly orally paced presentation is about 100-150 words per minute. Given that your presentation should be about 20 minutes, you can work against a minimum of 2,000 to a maximum of 2,500 words in your oral presentation/transcript.

**Please Note:** Appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.

### Learning Outcomes
 - Design, develop and evaluate management systems to produce solutions that handle constraints and uncertainty, contextualising BDD concepts and practices in SDLC.
 - Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organisation.
