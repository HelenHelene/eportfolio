# Seminar Preparation: Estimating Tools and Risk Assessment

## Introduction
Review the [NIST Privacy tools](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/resources). 
How do these fit with the risk assessment methods and tools described in last weekâ€™s Lecturecast: **Estimating, planning and risk**?

Create a Python program that implements one of the estimation methods covered in the Lecturecast. 
You can use the Jupyter Notebook workspace (see software installation below) and save your work to your GitHub repository.

Based on the requirements you have gathered for your assignment, create an estimate of the total effort and time to complete the planned demonstration of your system.
 
For the seminar session, be prepared to share your estimates and the reasons why you selected your chosen estimation method.  Use the python program you have created to calculate your estimates.

## Software Installations
We will be using Jupyter Notebook to write and run Python scripts. [Download the latest version of Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

You can also use the [Jupyter Notebook in the cloud](https://id.anaconda.cloud/ui/login?flow=3d5ad34f-3ba1-4677-b759-60ea66b07cd7). 
However you need to sign in with an account credential to access this tool. Alternatively you can access the site via [Jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/try).
