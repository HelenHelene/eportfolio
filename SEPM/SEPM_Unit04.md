# Unit 4: Estimating Tools and Risk Assessment

Welcome to Week 4 where we will discuss common risks and risk mitigation in large software projects. In addition, we will utilise some of the tools discussed in the previous lecture cast to create a project estimate.

In this unit we shall:
 - Discuss risks and risk mitigation in large software projects.
 - Produce an estimate for our summative project utilising the tools reviewed.
 - Review a number of estimating tools.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Select an appropriate tool for project estimation based on a number of common factors
 - Utilise the tool to create a project estimate.
 - Evaluate the usefulness of the tool in estimating.
 - Discuss risk evaluation and mitigation approaches.
