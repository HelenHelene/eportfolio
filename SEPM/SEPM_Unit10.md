# Unit 10: Software Quality Monitoring in Python

Welcome to Week 10, in which we will have a practical experience of achieving software quality monitoring in Python.

In this unit we shall:
 - Experiment with the use of Python linters to support the development of high-quality code.
 - Consider how the concept of software quality has evolved over time.
 - Examine how to recover a software engineering scenario from failure.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Use Python linters to implement quality code.
 - Describe how the concept of software quality has evolved over time.
 - Make suggestions on techniques to recover a software engineering project which has been considered to have failed. 

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activities to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:
