# Unit 10: Software Quality Monitoring in Python

In this unit, I gained practical experience in achieving software quality monitoring in Python. This included experimenting with Python linters to support the development of high-quality code, considering how the concept of software quality has evolved over time, and examining how to recover a software engineering scenario from failure.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, I will be able to use Python linters to implement quality code, describe how the concept of software quality has evolved over time, and make suggestions on techniques to recover a software engineering project that has been considered a failure. 

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activities to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

[Using Linters to Achieve Python Code Quality](SEPM_Unit10_Activity.md)

[Reflection on Software Quality](SEPM_Unit10_Reflection.md)

### Reflections
In Unit 10, I gained valuable insights into software quality monitoring in Python. Through various artefacts, I learned the significance of using linters like Pylint, Pyflakes, Pycodestyle, and Pydocstyle. Each tool has its strengths: Pylint for comprehensive checks, Pyflakes for logical errors, Pycodestyle for style adherence, and Pydocstyle for documentation consistency. These tools collectively enhance code quality by identifying errors and promoting best practices.

Additionally, my exploration of software quality evolution highlighted the contrasting perspectives of Fitzpatrick (1996) and Mertz (2019). Fitzpatrick's strategic approach emphasizes the role of quality in business success, whereas Mertz focuses on practical coding techniques. This dual perspective has deepened my understanding of how day-to-day coding practices and strategic planning both contribute to software quality.

### Action Plan
I plan to use linters in future coding assignments to ensure code quality and automate these checks in continuous integration pipelines to catch issues early. I'll maintain consistent documentation with Pydocstyle, updating it with every code change. Following PEP 8 standards and the Zen of Python, I'll ensure readability and simplicity in my code. I'll consider both practical and strategic aspects of software quality to enhance productivity and help improve my practices, aiming to create robust and maintainable software solutions.
