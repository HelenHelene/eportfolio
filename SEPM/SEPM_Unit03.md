### Reflections
In Unit 3, I learned about essential tools for estimating, planning, and risk management in project management, as well as the significance of data structures. Understanding these concepts provided insights into selecting appropriate tools for different project phases and improved my ability to manage complex systems. Exploring data structures, like those used in YouTube Music, highlighted their role in efficient operations and decision-making.

I will stay updated on the latest developments in project management and data structures. Collaborating with peers on team projects will be essential to gain feedback and refine my skills in project management.
