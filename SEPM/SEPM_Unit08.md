# Unit 8: Python Data Structures

This week, we conducted research into state-of-the-art connected technologies to identify the types of data they might produce and consume. We then considered how this data might be stored from a practical perspective by investigating data structure storage in Python.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Identify the most appropriate data structure to retain different attributes of data.
 - Use Pythonâ€™s built-in capabilities to retain data electronically.

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activity to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

### Reflections
During this unit, I gained valuable insights into the significance of data structures like queues and hash tables in system design. Queues efficiently manage playlists by maintaining song order and ensuring high performance. Hash tables facilitate quick access to song metadata, enhancing the user experience. The articles by Abeykoon et al. (2020) and Dicheva & Hodge (2018) highlighted the importance of scalability and choosing appropriate data structures. Moving forward, I plan to leverage these insights to optimize backend operations and improve user interactions in future projects. This unit reinforced the value of hands-on learning in grasping complex concepts.

### Action Plan
I plan to integrate the use of queues and hash tables more strategically to enhance system efficiency and user satisfaction. I will focus on further exploring the scalability of different data structures to ensure they can handle growing data loads without compromising performance.
