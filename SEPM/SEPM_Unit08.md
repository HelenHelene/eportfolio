# Unit 8: Python Data Structures

Welcome to Week 8 where we will carry out some research into state-of-the-art in connected technologies, with a view to identifying the types of data which they might produce and consume. We will then consider how this data might be stored from a more practical perspective so that it may be used electronically through investigating data structure storage in Python. 

In this unit we shall:
 - Select an article from a reputable online IT-related magazine on connected technology. 
 - Review the data structures which are available in Python to support the retention of data electronically. 
 - Perform an implementation of the data structures that you have identified in Python. 

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Identify the most appropriate data structure to retain different attributes of data. 
 - Use Pythonâ€™s built-in capabilities to practically retain data electronically

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activity to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:
