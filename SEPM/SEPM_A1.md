### [Assignment 1: Development Team Project: Project Report](SEPM_A1_Intro.pdf)

<br>

**Due:** Monday, 9 September 2024, 11:55 PM

In this unit, the focus is on the first objective/deliverable, the project report. This assignment has two component parts, the team submission and your individual peer assessment. 
All components must be submitted by end of Unit 6. This accounts for 20% of your final module mark. 
**Only one submission is required from each team with a limit of 2 pages. Nominate one member of your team to submit on the team's behalf. The word count is 1,000 words.**

### Full Brief
You are provided with a transcript between two (hypothetical) characters in [chapter 2 of the case study](SEPM_A1_CaseStudy.pdf) and [Appendix 1](SEPM_A1_Appendix1.pdf) & [Appendix 2](SEPM_A1_Appendix2.pdf). 
You are required to analyse the transcript and extract the initial requirements of both stakeholders and critique them with respect to assumptions and gaps in what is provided.

Based on the information supplied in the provided case study, your tasks are as follows.

You (your group) are required to produce a proposal that details a suitable development methodology (e.g. waterfall or agile based) for the system under consideration, supported by a discussion that justifies the choice of methodology. 
You should also produce a set of requirements (derived from the supplied discussion transcript), a development plan with suitable milestones, proposed deliverables and an estimated cost of the system (based on the supplied BOMs and the miscellaneous information provided below).

### Checklist
Each deliverable for this assessment is mentioned below and is equally distributed across 3 grading criteria (see Module Resources for the full list):

1. Specify a design approach/methodology that should be used to create the system discussed above, with justification for your selection. (Knowledge and Understanding, 25%).
   
2. Create a table that lists the requirements you have gathered from the exchange above. What requirements do you think are missing? Explicitly state the assumptions you need to make to be able to design the project plan.
 
3. Select the key requirements from the list. Create a number of Gherkin specifications that express the exact specifications in terms of Gherkin statements – you should create at least TEN statements. (Application of Knowledge, 25%).
 
4. Create a fully costed project plan for the system you have designed - this plan should detail the cost price of a single system, when the first prototypes will be ready, when models will be available for sale and when you expect to be generating income. Your budget is £500,000 and you cannot go above this until you have generated income from the sale of the machines. Your other main constraints are: 2,000 machines have been purchased by EDC; the agreed cost price; Syn expects the machines to be ready for sale by January 1984 at the latest (i.e. approximately 13 months maximum time line for the plan).(Application of Knowledge, 25%).

5. The plan should include design times, build times and testing times for both software and hardware. You, as the project manager, will need to decide how much testing time each stage requires, with justifications. Bear in mind you will need to account for unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing at the very least.

6. You are also expected to determine the sell price of the completed machine. (Criticality, 25%).

7. Ensure that you produce a business-ready proposal, that is well structured with no typographical errors. It should be well structured and present your recommendations in a clear and easy to read format. It should have been proofread before it is submitted (Structure and Presentation, 25%).

8. Finally, ensure your justifications for decisions made are based on good academic principles and that any academic sources you have used/referred to are clearly cited and that your references are presented in the required UoEO format.

### Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and apply appropriate software engineering and project management methodologies, tools and techniques for the development of solutions to real-world problems.
 - Explore the implications of computer and network architectures for system-level design and development, as appropriate for risk and quality management.
 - Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organisation.
