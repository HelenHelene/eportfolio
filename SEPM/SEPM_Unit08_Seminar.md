# Seminar Preparation: Data Structures

## Introduction
You will now become familiar with data structures, which are approaches to organise, store and manage electronic data. 
To do this, visit [python.org (n.d.)](https://www.python.org/), and any other relevant sources of information that you may find useful to support this task.
 - Select at least two different **data structures** to hold the data associated with the **list of functional and non-functional requirements** that you defined for Task 1.
 - Justify your data structure choices.
 - Select at least one **academic paper**, which might be similar to the work of [Abeykoon et al. (2020)](SEPM_Unit08_Reading.pdf).
 - Use your sourced information to support your data structure choices.
