# Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management

This module introduces the role of the Software Engineering Project Manager, emphasizing the blend of traditional project management skills (like resource management and planning) with technical skills (such as requirement management and agile management). 
It explores the need for and history of software engineering project management (SEPM), comparing it with traditional project management.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Describe several large projects and analyze reasons for their failure.
 - Explain the relationship between Project Management, TOGAF, and the SDLC.
 - Describe the differences between the development of the Software Engineering and Project Management disciplines.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I participated in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - Project Failures Study](SEPM_Unit01_Discussion.pdf)

### Reflections
Reflecting on this module, I've gained insight into how SEPM integrates both managerial and technical expertise. 
Understanding the differences from traditional project management has highlighted the unique challenges and solutions in software projects. 
Participating in discussions on project failures has been particularly enlightening, providing real-world context to theoretical concepts.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
I plan to continue participating in collaborative discussions and study different project failure cases to understand their root causes and mitigation strategies. 
This approach will not only aid in completing assignments but also prepare me for real-world scenarios.
