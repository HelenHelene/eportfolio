### [Assignment 3: Individual e-Portfolio Submission](SEPM_A3_Reflection)

<br>

**Due:** Monday, 21 October 2024, 11:55 PM

The final assessment in this module is an individual e-portfolio that collates all the evidence of your work in this module. 
It accounts for 40% of the overall module mark. The word count is 2,500 words, with **1,000** of these words being used for the reflection. Submit by end of Unit 12.

### Assignment Details
This assessment focuses on your reflections on being part of a development team and your individual contributions throughout this module, as well as your evaluation of your team's work in unit 6. You will also need to include screenshots (or similar) of your individual contributions to the team projects - these are not applied to your word count for this submission. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through.

In creating the content, some people find a diary style approach helps. You can use this Reflection Toolkit from the University of Edinburgh to get further guidance on reflection. For example, you can use Rolfe et al.’s (2001) approach. You could start by providing a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incident (WHAT), analyse and interpret the information (SO WHAT) and then decide how you can use the information and learning from it (NOW WHAT). You can find out more about the structure of your reflection by visiting the e-portfolio page on the department site.  

These are some exploratory questions from the grading criteria to help you develop your reflection:

 - Have you clearly described the topic of your project and the various aspects of project which are key to your reflection? (Application of Knowledge, 20%).
 - Emotional Response and Analysis. Critically analyse yourself and your own behaviour during this project.  How did working on the project make you feel?  How did these emotions affect you and your work?  Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done? (Application of Knowledge, 20% and Criticality, 40%).
 - Learning and Changed Actions. Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this project. (Application of Knowledge, 20% and Criticality, 40%).
 - Do you have evidence of skills and knowledge developed through this project?  Provide a clear description of your evidence of learning during this project and how you can apply (or have applied) them in a real-world experience. (Application of Knowledge, 20% and Criticality, 40%).
 - You will need to evidence and evaluate your individual contribution to a group project and the completion of tasks to the required standard. You will also need to demonstrate clear participation in the team activities as it informs your reflection. Legible screenshots from your e-portfolio are acceptable and will not affect your word count. (Collaboration, 20%).
 - Is there an accurate use of citations and references throughout this piece of work? Have you demonstrated the required integrity in your submission? (Academic Integrity, 10%).

The emphasis here is not on the look and feel of your reflection. The content of your reflection must be well organised, communicating your thoughts in a clear and concise manner, taking into account any requirements from the assessment guidance. Your work should have minimal errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. (Structure and Presentation, 10%)

It is expected that reflections will be written as you progress through the module, as listed above. The final reflective piece that you prepare, which might include components of the reflections that you have captured throughout the module is the piece which should be capped at the given word limit.


### Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and apply appropriate software engineering and project management methodologies, tools and techniques for the development of solutions to real-world problems.
 - Explore the implications of computer and network architectures for system-level design and development, as appropriate for risk and quality management.
 - Design, develop and evaluate management systems to produce solutions that handle constraints and uncertainty, contextualising BDD concepts and secure coding principles & practices in SDLC.
 - Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organisation.
