# Unit 6: pytest and Test-Driven Development

Welcome to Week 6. This week, we will examine the steps to provision a Test-driven development in Python using pytest. We will also consider the capabilities of a UX employee. 

In this unit we shall:
 - Investigate the test-driven development of an application in Python which makes use of pytest.
 - Examine the role responsibilities of a User Experience researcher.
 - Consider the impact of emotional reactions on user experience.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Achieve an application development through using test-driven development. 
 - Appreciate the roles to be played when working within User Experience research.
 - Contextualise a reaction to a software development project on the basis of the emotions of the stakeholders.

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activity to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

### Reflections
Reflecting on Unit 6, I've deepened my understanding of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with pytest and its pivotal role in software development. This approach emphasizes writing tests before code, ensuring that each component functions as intended. The hands-on experience with pytest reinforced the importance of automated testing in maintaining code reliability and quality. Additionally, exploring the responsibilities of a User Experience (UX) researcher highlighted how crucial user emotions and interactions are in designing effective applications. Recognizing the emotional impact on user experience helps in creating more intuitive and user-friendly software.

### Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan
I plan to enhancing my TDD skills by practicing with more complex Python projects and reviewing open-source projects to learn different testing strategies. I'll explore advanced pytest features and attend workshops for deeper insights. Additionally, I'll perform research and study cases of successful UX design, focusing on user feedback and emotional considerations to create better interfaces. By concentrating on these areas, I aim to improve my TDD skills and integrate UX insights into software development.
