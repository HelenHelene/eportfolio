# Unit 6: pytest and Test-Driven Development

In Unit 6, we will examine the steps to implement test-driven development in Python using pytest. We will also consider the capabilities of a UX employee. We will investigate the test-driven development of an application in Python with pytest, examine the role and responsibilities of a User Experience researcher, and explore the impact of emotional reactions on user experience.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Develop an application using test-driven development.
 - Appreciate the roles involved in User Experience research.
 - Contextualize reactions to a software development project based on the emotions of stakeholders.

### Artefacts 
I have completed the following activity to meet these learning outcomes, which are recorded in the link below:

### Reflections
Reflecting on Unit 6, I've deepened my understanding of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with pytest and its pivotal role in software development. This approach emphasizes writing tests before code, ensuring that each component functions as intended. The hands-on experience with pytest reinforced the importance of automated testing in maintaining code reliability and quality. Additionally, exploring the responsibilities of a User Experience (UX) researcher highlighted how crucial user emotions and interactions are in designing effective applications. Recognizing the emotional impact on user experience helps in creating more intuitive and user-friendly software.

### Action Plan
I plan to enhancing my TDD skills by practicing with more complex Python projects and reviewing open-source projects to learn different testing strategies. I'll explore advanced pytest features and attend workshops for deeper insights. Additionally, I'll perform research and study cases of successful UX design, focusing on user feedback and emotional considerations to create better interfaces. By concentrating on these areas, I aim to improve my TDD skills and integrate UX insights into software development.
