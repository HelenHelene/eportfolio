# e-Portfolio Activity: Reflection on Software Quality

## Introduction
This activity requires us to review the article by McCall, Richards & Walters (1977), however it is unavailable in the UoE resources and its high cost on Amazon, I have selected two alternative sources, Mertz (2019) and Fitzpatrick (1996), to compare the major differences in relation to software quality.

## Major Differences 
The article by Fitzpatrick (1996) explores software quality through a strategic lens, discussing definitions and quality models like McCall's, and emphasizing factors such as reliability, maintainability, and usability. Fitzpatrick examines how these factors impact business strategies, system acquisition, and productivity, providing a comprehensive overview of software quality in organizational contexts.

In contrast, Mertz (2019) focuses on practical techniques for writing clean, Pythonic code. The emphasis is on code readability, following the Zen of Python, and using tools like linters and auto-formatters. Mertz highlights four key strategies: using tools, structuring projects properly, following style guides, and documenting thoroughly.

While Fitzpatrick provides a broad theoretical framework for understanding software quality, Mertz offers actionable advice for developers to enhance code quality in their projects. The former is more concerned with strategic and organizational implications, whereas the latter targets individual coding practices.
 
## Reflections
From this comparison, I learned the importance of both strategic and practical approaches to software quality. Fitzpatrick's work underscores how quality impacts business decisions and long-term success, while Mertz reminds us that daily coding practices contribute significantly to the overall quality of software. Balancing these perspectives can lead to more robust and maintainable software solutions.
