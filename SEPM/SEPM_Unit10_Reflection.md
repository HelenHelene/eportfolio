# e-Portfolio Activity: Reflection on Software Quality

## Introduction
This activity requires us to review the article by McCall, Richards & Walters (1977), however it is unavailable in the UoE resources and its high cost on Amazon, I have selected two alternative sources, Mertz (2019) and Fitzpatrick (1996), to compare the major differences in relation to software quality.

## Major Differences 
The article by Fitzpatrick (1996) explores software quality through a strategic lens, discussing definitions and quality models, and emphasizing factors such as reliability, maintainability, and usability. Fitzpatrick examines how these factors impact business strategies, system acquisition, and productivity, providing a comprehensive overview of software quality in organizational contexts.

Below is the key points of Software Quality by Fitzpatrick (1996):
1. Definitions of Software Quality: The document explores various definitions and models of software quality, highlighting McCall's model and its factors like efficiency, reliability, and usability.
2. Quality Models: It discusses quality factors and their categorization into internal and external qualities, emphasizing the importance of these factors in software development and evaluation.
3. Strategic Importance: The impact of software quality on business strategies, including product differentiation, cost estimation, and system acquisition, is examined.
4. Human Factors: The role of human resources in achieving quality is stressed, suggesting that skilled personnel are crucial for maintaining high standards.
5. Evolving Standards: The document notes the need for updated quality models to reflect technological advancements and the evolving nature of software development.


In contrast, Mertz (2019) focuses on practical techniques for writing clean, Pythonic code. The emphasis is on code readability, following the Zen of Python, and using tools like linters and auto-formatters. 

Below is the key points Mertz highlighted by Mertz (2019): 
1. Importance of Readability: Emphasizes the significance of writing code that is easy to read and understand, following the Pythonic philosophy.
2. The Zen of Python: Highlights core principles like simplicity, readability, and explicitness as crucial guidelines for Python development.
3. Using Tools: Recommends using tools like linters and auto-formatters (e.g., black.py, PyLint) to maintain code quality and adhere to PEP 8 standards.
4. Project Structure: Suggests organizing projects properly to enhance navigation, readability, and maintainability.
5. Documentation: Stresses the importance of documenting code thoroughly to aid understanding and future development.
6. Consistency with PEP 8: Encourages following PEP 8 style guide for consistent and clean coding practices.


While Fitzpatrick provides a broad theoretical framework for understanding software quality, Mertz offers actionable advice for developers to enhance code quality in their projects. The former is more concerned with strategic and organizational implications, whereas the latter targets individual coding practices.
 
## Reflections
From this comparison, I learned the importance of both strategic and practical approaches to software quality. Fitzpatrick's work underscores how quality impacts business decisions and long-term success, while Mertz reminds us that daily coding practices contribute significantly to the overall quality of software. Balancing these perspectives can lead to more robust and maintainable software solutions.
