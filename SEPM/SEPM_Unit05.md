# Unit 5: User Experience

Welcome to Week 5, during which we will examine the concept of User Experience during a software development project. We consider the variety of stakeholders involved in a project, whose User Experience is prioritised. The critical role which is played by the Project Manager in facilitating this is also considered. 

In this unit we shall:
 - Examine the concepts of usability and user experience. 
 - Review the ways by which User Experience might be monitored and managed.
 - Explore the metrics which are used to measure User Experience.
 - Investigate Pythonâ€™s built-in capabilities to support Test-driven Development, through which a good User Experience can be supported.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Write a project plan, through which maximum efforts are being made to ensure a high-quality User Experience. 
 - Define a strategy by which the User Experience can be measured and managed. 
 - Recognise how to implement a Test-driven Development approach in Python.
