# API Demonstrations

## Requirement
In this session, we will expand the API [Unit 7](SSD_Unit07.md) with functionality relevant to your summative code submission. Expand the API created in [Unit 7](SSD_Unit07.md) with functionality relevant to your summative code submission.

You are also welcome to demo your summative code assessment in [Week 10](SSD_Unit10.md) if you are complete by then, but the session is arranged for [Week 11](SSD_Unit11.md) to give you the maximum time available. The demonstrations in this seminar are for the API seminar work, without the assumption that your summative assessment development is complete by then.

Read the paper: [S. Fiore et al. (2019)](SSD_Unit10_SeminarReference.pdf). Making reference to page 117659 and the paragraph which begins, "Through an API or via web pages, ...", write a similar paragraph which is applicable for the system that you have designed and developed."

Please remember that these demonstrations are in line with academic integrity requirements; you will not get full marks by only delivering working code in [Unit 11](SSD_Unit11.md).

Where it is not possible for all team members to join the session this week, a separate session should be arranged with the tutor.
