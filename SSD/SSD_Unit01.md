# Unit 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development

In Unit 1, we explored key concepts essential for secure software development. 
The focus was on comparing traditional waterfall methods with agile approaches, particularly in how they support secure software practices. 
We also delved into the Unified Modeling Language (UML), specifically using flow charts to model software processes, which is crucial for visualizing and improving software security.

Additionally, the unit emphasized the need for a risk-aware culture within organizations. 
While developing secure software is vital, fostering a security-conscious mindset among developers and maintainers is equally important.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, we should be able to:
 - Identify academic literature on secure software development using agile methodologies.
 - Break down activities into tasks using UML flow charts.
 - Understand the significance of a risk-aware culture alongside secure software creation.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I participated in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - UML Flowchart-Initial post](SSD_Unit01_Discussion.pdf)

### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I gained a deeper understanding of how agile methodologies can enhance secure software development. The practical application of UML diagrams, such as Activity Diagrams, proved valuable in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the feedback from my tutor was instrumental in enhancing my UML knowledge, which I will incorporate into the summary post in Unit 3.

### Action Plan
Moving forward, I plan to continue engaging in collaborative discussions to deepen my understanding of secure software development. I will further explore how UML can be used to enhance security in software processes, integrating these insights into my work.
