# Activity - Exploring Python tools and features

## Part I
In this example, you will compile and run a program in C using the Jupyter notebook workspace provided (Buffer Overflow in C). The program is already provided as bufoverflow.c - a simple program that creates a buffer and then asks you for a name, and prints it back out to the screen.

This is the code in bufoverflow.c. You are able to download the zip file **'buffer-overflow-in-c'**. 
Additional instructions are provided in the [Buffer Overflow PDF](SSD_Unit03_Activity1Reference.pdf).

```python
#include <stdio.h> 
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
char buf[8]; // buffer for eight characters
printf("enter name:"); 
gets(buf); // read from stdio (sensitive function!)
printf("%s\n", buf); // print out data stored in buf
return 0; // 0 as return value
{
```

Now compile and run the code. To test it, enter your first name (or at least the first 8 characters of it) you should get the output which is just your name repeated back to you.

Run the code a second time (from the command window this can be achieved by entering ./bufoverflow on the command line). This time, enter a string of 10 or more characters.

 - What happens?
 - What does the output message mean?

## Part II
Now carry out a comparison of this code with one in Python (Buffer Overflow in Python), following these instructions:

In your workspace, you will be using the file called Overflow.py. You are able to download the zip file **'buffer-overflow-in-python'** along with additional instructions in the PDF [Exploring Python Tools and Features](SSD_Unit03_Activity1Reference2.pdf).

```python
buffer=[None]*10
for i in range (0,11):
    buffer[i]=7
print(buffer)
```

 - Run your code using: Python overflow.py (or use the codio rocket icon)
 - What is the result?
 - Read about Pylint at http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/tutorial.html
 - Install pylint using the following commands:<br>
   * _pip install pylint (in the command shell/ interpreter)_ <br>
 - Run pylint on one of your files and evaluate the output:<br>
   * _pylint your_file_ <br>
 - (Make sure you are in the directory where your file is located before running Pylint)
 - What is the result? Does this tell you how to fix the error above?

Be prepared to discuss your thoughts on both exercises at next weekâ€™s seminar. Remember to record this into your e-portfolio.
