#### Introduction
This reflection records my learning outcomes from the [Software Engineering Project Management (SEPM) module](SSD_main.md). 
The module not only deepened my understanding of SEPM theories and concepts but also enhanced my soft skills, significantly contributing to my professional and personal development. 
It provided valuable insights into effective project management methodologies, collaborative teamwork, and practical applications of software engineering principles.

#### Summary of learning outcomes
A central component of this module was our [first team project](SSD_A1.md), developing a proposal for a computer development initiative called "Synputer". 
The proposal detailed suitable development methodologies, requirements, development plans, milestones, deliverables, and estimated costs.

Another key assignment was the [individual project presentation](SSD_A2.md) which is the second deliverable of the team project – a presentation to stakeholders on mitigating challenges and implementing changes. 
This assignment focused on soft skills like change management and presentation abilities, crucial for project managers who need to translate technical information for non-technical audiences. 
In my professional role, I often present financial results to stakeholders without a financial background, facing similar challenges.

Beyond the presentation content, I learned how to record a presentation and add subtitles, which is an unexpected but valuable part of the learning process.

The final assignment was the [e-portfolio submission](https://helenhelene.github.io/eportfolio/) and reflection, documenting my entire MSc Computer Science journey.  
For more insight into my background, an [About Me](https://helenhelene.github.io/eportfolio/Professional.html) section is available on the GitHub-hosted website. 
I separated [each unit with individual learning outcomes and reflections](SSD_main.md), which record all artefacts from my learning journey and practical experiences.

Throughout the module, I completed [all discussion and e-portfolio activities](SEPM_ArtefactsSummary.md), including collaborative discussions, Gherkin exercises, data structures reflections, risk assessment, estimating tools activities, and code improvement and testing. 
Several pieces of work left me a strong impression and prompted reflection. 
For example, [Unit 9 Improving Code Quality](SSD_Unit09_Activity.md) allowed me to revisit and enhance my first Python program using techniques learned, such as adhering to PEP 8 standards, using snake_case, and incorporating meaningful docstrings. 
I observed significant improvement and knowledge gained during this journey.  
[Units 3](SSD_Unit03_Activity.md) and [8](SSD_Unit08_Seminar.md) were also enlightening, offering a chance to deeply understand the data structure of YouTube Music, which I use daily but had not previously analyzed.

#### Evidence of Teamwork and Peer Interactions
During the team project, as the only member in a different time zone and with a different mother tongue, I faced challenges coordinating with peers. 
However, our team demonstrated remarkable adaptability, scheduling meetings convenient for all.

We exemplified effective collaboration. The [team contract](SSD_A1_MoM.md) we developed outlined roles, responsibilities, and expectations, fostering accountability, and [regular meetings](SSD_A1_MoM.md) facilitated open communication.

I am relatively strong in documentation and administrative work, so I took the initiative in [drafting the team contract, taking minutes, outlining milestones, and calculating budgets and costs](SSD_A1_MoM_ProjectReportDraft_20240815.pdf). 
My financial and management background enabled me to contribute effectively. Other team members, with strengths in software development, focused on creating domain models, Gantt charts, and reviewing technical requirements to ensure realism in our proposal.

We utilized tools like [Trello](SSD_A1_Trello.jpg) for task management and shared documents for collaborative editing. 
[Every team member had a clear role allocation based on individual strengths, enhancing team efficiency](SSD_A1_MoM_ProjectReportDraft_20240815.pdf).

One instance highlighting teamwork was when we faced uncertainties in the project's technical requirements and timeline. 
A team member suggested using domain modeling and Gantt charts to visualize our proposal. This peer-led knowledge sharing enhanced our understanding and improved our proposal.

#### Learning and Changed Actions
Initially, I felt apprehensive about group work due to time zone differences, fearing missed discussions and communication barriers. 
However, as we collaborated, these anxieties diminished. The team's willingness to accommodate my schedule made me feel valued.

Excited by the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge practically, I also felt pressure from coordinating vital project components. 
These emotions motivated me to be proactive and diligent. Positive team dynamics boosted my confidence, leading me to take on roles I might have previously avoided.

Peer feedback was instrumental in shaping my behavior. Recognition of my organizational skills encouraged greater contribution, while constructive criticism helped me identify areas for improvement, such as enhancing technical detail in documentation.

Through challenges, I realized the importance of effective communication, adaptability, and embracing diverse perspectives. Coordinating across time zones required flexibility and planning. 
I became more proficient with project management tools like Trello and developed skills in drafting comprehensive team contracts.

The experience taught me the value of clear role allocation based on strengths, enhancing efficiency. Recognizing my team members' diligence inspired me to strive for higher standards.

The skills and knowledge developed have significant real-world applicability. 
In my role as Head of Finance and IT Operations, upcoming projects involve digitalization and ERP system migration. 
With a deeper understanding of the project life cycle and management methodologies, I can contribute more effectively, particularly in requirement gathering, user acceptance testing (UAT), and enhancing user experience.

My ability to draft detailed project documentation, manage budgets, and outline milestones are directly transferable skills. 
Improved proficiency with project management tools will aid in coordinating tasks and communicating with stakeholders professionally.
