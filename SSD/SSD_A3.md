#### Introduction
This reflection summarises my learning outcomes from the Secure Software Development (SSD) module.  In addition to expanding my theoretical understanding of secure software, it strengthened my technical abilities and team-oriented skills. The module offered valuable insights into identifying and managing security risks, designing robust software, and working in diverse teams.

#### Summary of learning outcomes
A central aspect of the module involved a Team project – Design Document, where we designed a secure application for an online retailer. We produced a detailed document outlining core requirements, security concerns with mitigation strategies, relevant development methodologies, UML diagrams, and approaches to testing.

The second assignment, Individual Project – Output and Evidence of Testing and Demonstration, required implementing our prior design in Python. This entailed making appropriate security decisions, integrating the chosen libraries, and deploying effective testing techniques. Although the module did not provide an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), I self-learned Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which I had briefly explored during a previous module, enabling me to gain additional hands-on experience.

Beyond coding, the requirement to demonstrate our work pushed me to think carefully about how to present software to stakeholders, which is an aspect of development often overshadowed by purely technical tasks.

Finally, the third assignment comprised an e-portfolio submission (Appendix 1) and reflection documenting my journey through the MSc Computer Science.  My Professional Profile (Appendix 2) originally contained personal details, but professor’s feedback encouraged me to revise it to highlight professional attributes instead.

Throughout the module, I completed the majority of e-Portfolio tasks compiled in each unit (Appendix 3) and documented in the  List of Artefacts (Appendix 4).  These included UML and security discussions, various coding exercises that covered recursion, regular expressions, cryptography, and API development.

Several activities stood out.  For instance, the first collaborative discussion - UML Flowchart (Appendix 5), helped me improve an Activity Diagram illustrating a secure login process. Professor’s feedback prompted me to enhance both structure and clarity, which proved central to our Design Document and future work.

The Towers of Hanoi exercise in Unit 4 (Appendix 6) introduced me to a mathematical puzzle I had previously seen only as a toy. Implementing a recursive solution was both stimulating and rewarding. I even acquired a miniature Hanoi Tower for my desk as a lasting reminder of the underlying logic.

Units 7 and 9 emphasised API development (Appendix 7).  Configuring multiple terminals and using w3m within a Windows environment proved tricky, yet working through these problems enriched my problem-solving skills. These real-world scenarios mirrored the hurdles one might face in a professional setting.

In Unit 8 Cryptography Programming (Appendix 8), I explored Fernet encryption from the Python cryptography library. Although I had used cryptography tools in a practical sense before, this exercise afforded me a deeper understanding of how best to manage encryption libraries and methods for enhanced software security.


#### Evidence of Teamwork and Peer Interactions
Coordinating a multinational team with varied schedules and language backgrounds tested our flexibility. We held regular meetings and drafted a thorough team contract (Appendix 9) that summarised our responsibilities, ensuring that each member’s skills were fully utilised. I took charge of documentation, compliance, and administrational tasks, while more coding-focused team members handled library selection and deep technical queries. Employing Trello (Appendix 10) helped us keep track of tasks and maintain clear accountability.

Even after finalising our team project, collective support continued. We shared insights, exchanged ideas, and clarified uncertainties throughout the preparation for Individual Assignment 2. A senior developer in my network offered invaluable help when I encountered setbacks with Python-based libraries. Without their support, relying solely on the coding activities in the module may not have been sufficient to successfully finalise Assignment 2. Whilst there is still room for refinement, seeing the software run reliably without errors confirmed the effort invested.

#### Learning and Changed Actions
The scale of this module felt vast at first, particularly for a part-time student juggling assignments alongside professional obligations. Nonetheless, the complex workload propelled me to sharpen my time management strategies and acknowledge the need for external support on occasion. I learned to proactively clear hurdles related to IDEs, coding complexities, and international team interactions, all of which boosted my confidence and preparedness for future software projects.

Demonstrating the software to the professor presented another challenge. The mixture of anticipation and apprehension ensured I practised running the programme repeatedly, simplified processes, and rehearsed potential questions. Ultimately, the demonstration’s positive reception reinforced my belief in the importance of careful presentation alongside technical competence.

During the Cryptography Programming exercise in Unit 8 (Appendix 8), I initially planned to implement Fernet encryption for password handling in Assignment 2. After greater scrutiny, however, I realised it was not the most suitable approach for password management. This prompted additional research on password-hashing methods and a rewrite of my code, highlighting the importance of fully justifying technical decisions and applying critical thinking throughout a project.

Although my professional role in a management team rarely involves hands-on coding, the broad skills gained have enhanced my capacity to identify, select, and oversee the most suitable development tools for genuine business scenarios. Completing high-pressure group deliverables with tight deadlines and presenting my software to stakeholders proved both transformational and academically enriching.
