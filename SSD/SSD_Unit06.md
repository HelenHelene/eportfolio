# Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing

Welcome to Week 6. This week, we will examine the technologies that are available for use within the Python programming language to support the development of high-quality code. High quality code is important, with an assumption that high quality code will be secure.

In this unit we shall:
 - Apply linters to support quality Python code development.
 - Appreciate the different contributions from linters which are described as having similar objectives, and to realise their applicability and utility in different scenarios.
 - Correct Python code so that it is free from error and consistent in its design.


### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Be familiar with using linters to support quality Python code development.
 - Compare and contrast the outputs from linters to recognise their relevance and applicability in different development and testing scenarios.
 - Develop Python code, which is free of error, consistent in its design, and considered to be high quality according to common Python standards.

The content in Week 6 is important as it exposes students to the tools and techniques which are available within the Python programming language to support the development of code which is both high quality and secure. This will be directly applicable, and important, within the context of the summative assessment.
