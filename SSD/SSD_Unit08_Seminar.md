# Cryptography Programming Exercise

## Requirement
Read the [Cryptography with Python blog at tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_quick_guide.htm). 
Select one of the methods described/ examples given and create a python program that can take a short piece of text and encrypt it.

Create a python program (you can use the Jupyter Notebooks space) that can take a text file and output an encrypted version as a file in your folder on the system. Demonstrate your program operation in this week’s seminar session.

Answer the following questions in your e-portfolio:

 - Why did you select the algorithm you chose?
 - Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.

We will review your work from [Unit 7 (Python Shell)](SSD_Unit07.md) in this week’s seminar, as well as this cryptography activity. There will also be an opportunity to review your team’s assignment progress during the seminar.

Remember to record your results, ideas and team discussions in your e-portfolio and complete the activities in Unit 7. 

## Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.
 - Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.
 - Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a solution that meets the design brief and critically evaluate solutions that are produced.
