# Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems

During this unit, we explored the fundamental concepts of operating systems (OS) and their relationships with programming languages and security. We examined the functions of a typical operating system, discussed common examples, and analysed the differences between processes, threads, and schedulers. Additionally, we investigated key approaches to enhance OS security, compared virtualisation techniques, and evaluated the differences between static and dynamic libraries, identifying scenarios for their optimal use.

The unit also focused on the implications, risks, and challenges associated with choosing an operating system, as well as the impact of virtualisation on security. These topics provided a comprehensive understanding of why operating systems are critical for software development and how they influence the security of applications.


### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, we were able to:
 - Describe mitigations to make operating systems more secure.
 - Explain the key risks and vulnerabilities associated with operating systems.
 - Outline the differences between static and dynamic libraries and determine when to use each.

### Artefacts
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities which are documented in the provided link:

[What is an Ontology?](SSD_Unit07_Component.md) 

[Exploring a simple Python shell](SSD_Unit07_Activity1.md) 

[Developing an API for a Distributed Environment](SSD_Unit07_Activity2.md) <br><br> 

### Reflections
During this unit, I gained valuable insights into the critical role operating systems play in software development and security. For instance, I learned how operating systems manage processes, threads, and schedulers, which are essential for efficient resource utilisation. I also explored the risks and vulnerabilities associated with operating systems, such as issues arising from insecure library usage or virtualisation techniques, and how to mitigate them. This knowledge has helped me better understand how applications interact with the underlying OS and the importance of securing these interactions to prevent potential threats.

Through the artefacts, I expanded my understanding of related topics like ontologies, Python shells, and API development in distributed environments. In the "What is an Ontology?" exercise, I learned how formalising domain knowledge using structured frameworks facilitates efficient reasoning and interoperability across systems. This was particularly enlightening in helping me understand how semantic modelling can align technical implementations with business processes.

The Python shell exercise highlighted the importance of secure coding practices, especially in handling user inputs and preventing vulnerabilities like command injection. Similarly, the exercise on developing an API for a distributed environment allowed me to apply concepts of RESTful API development while being mindful of potential security risks. Overall, these artefacts reinforced the connection between operating systems, programming, and security in practical scenarios.

However, I faced challenges in implementing the API development exercise, mainly because my working environment differed from the typical "IT professional" setup. I understand that most IT professionals or students in IT-related courses are familiar with Linux operating systems and alternative IDEs, but this is not the case for me. As a result, I had to spend extra time gaining foundational knowledge of these basics. Although this process was time-consuming, it was highly engaging and mirrored the problem-solving scenarios often encountered in real-world development. This experience also proved beneficial in preparing me for future challenges.

### Action Plan
To enhance my understanding of operating systems and their relationship with programming and security, I plan to revisit the concepts covered in this unit while applying them to real-world problems. I aim to focus on improving my practical skills in securing OS-level interactions, such as implementing stricter input validation and using secure libraries within programming projects. For example, I will develop small projects that involve process management, threading, and virtualisation, ensuring that I incorporate the security mitigations discussed during this unit.

I also plan to enhance my knowledge of library usage by working on projects that require both static and dynamic libraries, analysing their performance and security implications in different scenarios. This will help me make more informed design decisions in future software development tasks.
