Good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending this presentation on the Synputer Project.  I am the project manager of this project.

Synputer project is crucial for both Synful Computing and our valued partner, EDC. As we progress, we have encountered challenges and identified necessary amendments to ensure the Synputer meets both the original specifications and the evolving demands of our stakeholders, including EDC and our marketing team. Our goal is to achieve this while staying with a reasonable budget and schedule.
