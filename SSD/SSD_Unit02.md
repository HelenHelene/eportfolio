# Unit 2: UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning

In week 2, I gained some practical skills regarding the creation of flow charts, which were used during the design stage of the SDLC and supported communications between stakeholders from that point onwards. I also gained an awareness of the opportunities for integrating software security development practices at each stage of the agile SDLC, experimented with the creation of UML flow charts, and understood the range of ways in which software security can be problematic.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, I was able to:
 - Research the academic literature on software development that follows an agile process and prioritizes security.
 - Break down the steps involved in a process so that they could be represented as a flow chart.
 - Read areas of an ISO/IEC Standard on security and become familiar with the language and concepts.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

Collaborative Discussion 1 - UML Flowchart-Respond to peers: [Respond 1](SSD_Unit02_Respond1.pdf) & [Respond 2](SSD_Unit02_Respond2.pdf)

### Reflections
Throughout this unit, I gained a deeper understanding of how to effectively incorporate security processes within the Scrum framework. By embedding security considerations from the beginning, I learned how to enhance the security posture of software projects. The exercises on managing insider cybersecurity threats highlighted the impact of human factors and the importance of strategic management to mitigate risks. These insights reinforced the necessity of integrating security at every development stage and managing human elements to prevent insider threats.

### Action Plan
To further enhance my project management skills, I plan to continue developing my ability to create detailed UML flowcharts. I will also focus on applying security integration techniques in real-world projects, ensuring ongoing learning and adaptation to emerging security challenges.
