# Unit 9: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment

This week, we investigated the application of CRUD capabilities in Python, continued to expand our knowledge of the capabilities of additional Python libraries, and created an API through which a system can perform file management. We also reflected on the utility of an ontology to support a distributed architecture.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, I will be able to:
 - Create an API and use it to create and read records.
 - Become familiar with the capabilities of Python’s Flask library.
 - Design an ontology that can be used in standardised service deployments.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, which are documented in the provided link:

Collaborative Discussion 1 - Cryptography Case Study - TrueCrypt: [Peer Response 1](SSD_Unit09_Respond1.pdf) & [Peer Response 2](SSD_Unit09_Respond2.pdf)<br><br>

### Reflections
During this unit, I gained valuable insights into the development of APIs in a distributed environment and how they can be effectively utilised for file management and data operations. The hands-on experience with Python’s Flask library was particularly beneficial, as it allowed me to create and interact with APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This helped solidify my understanding of back-end development and how APIs serve as a bridge between the back-end and front-end of a system.

Additionally, I explored the concept of ontology in the context of distributed architectures. By examining its utility in standardising service deployments, I learned how ontologies can support better organisation and clarity in distributed systems by defining relationships between various components. This was particularly evident in the collaborative discussions on TrueCrypt, where an ontology was used to classify vulnerabilities and their associated risks. This activity provided a practical example of how ontologies can be applied to enhance system design and security analysis.

My engagement with the cryptography case study allowed me to reflect on the importance of secure coding practices, particularly in legacy software like TrueCrypt. By analysing its vulnerabilities, such as weak random number generation and inadequate key derivation, I developed a deeper appreciation for the role of continuous security assessments and adopting modern cryptographic standards. This reinforced the need to stay updated with current practices, such as implementing PBKDF2, scrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing, and the importance of secure memory management techniques.

Overall, Unit 9 has equipped me with the practical skills required to develop secure and efficient APIs, as well as the theoretical understanding of ontologies and their role in distributed environments. It has also strengthened my knowledge of cryptographic principles and their application in real-world scenarios.

### Action Plan
To enhance my understanding and skills further, I plan to deepen my knowledge of building APIs with Flask.  I will implement these skills in my upcoming Assignment 2 by enhancing authentication and authorisation mechanisms.  Furthermore, I will study secure hashing algorithms such as Argon2 in greater detail and experiment with implementing them in future projects to ensure data security.

By following this action plan, I aim to strengthen my theoretical foundation and practical expertise, which will be invaluable for my future coursework and professional career in software engineering.
