# Programming language concepts: Programming exercises – recursion and regex

## Requirement
Please note that the Jupyter Notebook environment is available in Codio for you to carry out these activities. 
This week there are two programming exercises that will help you understand two valuable language concepts – **recursion and regex**.

## Recursion
One of the classic programming problems that is often solved by recursion is the towers of Hanoi problem. 
A good explanation and walkthrough are provided by [Cormen & Balkcom (n.d.)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/towers-of-hanoi/a/towers-of-hanoi). (the code they used for their visual example is provided on their website as well).

 - Read the explanation, study the code and then create your own version using Python (if you want to make it more interesting you can use asterisks to represent the disks). Create a version that asks for the number of disks and then executes the moves, and then finally displays the number of moves executed.
 - What is the (theoretical) maximum number of disks that your program can move without generating an error?
 - What limits the number of iterations? What is the implication for application and system security?

## Regex
The second language concept we will look at is regular expressions (regex). 
We have already presented some studies on their use, and potential problems, above. 
The lecturecast also contains a useful link to a tutorial on creating regex. 
Re-read the provided links and tutorial [(Jaiswal, 2020)](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-regular-expression-tutorial) and then attempt the problem presented below:

 - The UK postcode system consists of a string that contains a number of characters and numbers – a typical example is ST7 9HV (this is not valid – see below for why). The rules for the pattern are available from idealpostcodes (2020).
 - Create a python program that implements a regex that complies with the rules provided above – test it against the examples provided.
 - Examples:
      - M1 1AA
      - M60 1NW
      - CR2 6XH
      - DN55 1PT
      - W1A 1HQ
      - EC1A 1BB
- How do you ensure your solution is not subject to an evil regex attack?

You can share your responses with tutor for formative feedback or discuss it in this week’s seminar. 
There will also be an opportunity to review your team’s progress during the seminar.

Remember to record your results, ideas and team discussions in your e-portfolio.

## Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.
 - Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.
 - Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a solution that meets the design brief and critically evaluate solutions that are produced.
