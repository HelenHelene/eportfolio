# Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts

Welcome to Week 4 where we will investigate and explore the effect of key programming concepts on system security. We will focus on two concepts in particular: regular expressions and recursion.

In this unit we shall:
 - Explore the use of regular expressions and recursion in creating software solutions.
 - Investigate the effects of using regular expressions and recursion on system security.
 - Recommend the most suitable approaches for given security requirements/ risk appetites.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Explain how and when to use regular expressions in solutions.
 - Describe how and when to use recursion in solutions.
 - Discuss the security implications of both approaches.

This section will provide you with the opportunity to explore two programming language concepts and to investigate the pros and cons of both approaches. This section will also help you understand how the application of such concepts can affect overall system and solution security.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities, which are documented in the provided link:
