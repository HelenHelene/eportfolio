# Exploring a simple Python shell

## Requirement
In this session, you will create a command shell in Python, and then run it and answer questions about it. You can use your chosen **Jupyter Notebook space** for your work.

Review the blogs at [Praka (2018)] and [Szabo (n.d.)] and then create a CLI/ shell that implements the following:

 - When you enter the command LIST it lists the contents of the current directory
 - The ADD command will add the following two numbers together and provide the result
 - The HELP command provides a list of commands available
 - The EXIT command exits the shell

Add suitable comments to your code and add the program to your e-portfolio. Be prepared to demonstrate it in the seminar session next week.

Run the shell you have created, try a few commands and then answer the questions below. Be prepared to discuss your answers in the seminar.

 - What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?
 - What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell?
 - Add a section to your e-portfolio that provides a (pseudo)code example of changes you would make to the shell to improve its security.

Remember to also record your results, ideas and team discussions in your e-portfolio.

## Learning Outcomes
 - Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.
 - Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.
 - Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a solution that meets the design brief and critically evaluate solutions that are produced.
