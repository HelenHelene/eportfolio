# Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures

During this unit, we investigated the evolution of system architectures, ranging from traditional monolithic deployments to modern microservices, virtualisation, and containers. We explored how these architectures have developed over time and examined the unique security challenges they present, particularly in distributed environments. As the operational landscape shifts towards distributed systems, we recognised the increased attack surface and the need for intelligent techniques to protect data in transit. The unit also focused on encryption methods and key distribution patterns, as well as the vulnerabilities specific to virtualised environments.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I was able to:

 - Describe the evolution of distributed systems and how patterns in architecture have changed over time.
 - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various distributed approaches, including monolithic, microservices, and virtualisation.
 - Identify and describe security attacks specific to virtual systems and distributed environments.
 - Understand how distributed systems can be protected using encryption techniques and secure virtualisation practices.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of this unit, I engaged in collaborative discussions and completed the following activities to reinforce my understanding:

[Faceted Data](SSD_Unit10_Component.md) <br><br> 


### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I developed a comprehensive understanding of how distributed systems have evolved and the security challenges they face. The discussion on TrueCrypt underscored the importance of maintaining up-to-date encryption methods and avoiding reliance on outdated or unsupported tools. I gained a clear perspective on how vulnerabilities, such as weak key derivation and improper handling of sensitive data, can compromise security in distributed environments.

The exploration of faceted data deepened my knowledge of dynamic information flow security, particularly in systems where data needs to be securely viewed and accessed by users with varying privileges. This concept, though complex, has practical applications in preventing data leakage and ensuring confidentiality in distributed systems. Additionally, I gained an appreciation of how security attacks, such as those targeting virtualised environments, require tailored solutions due to their unique nature.

These activities helped me connect theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, strengthening my ability to critically evaluate system architectures and their associated risks. I also recognised the importance of encryption and key management in safeguarding distributed systems, which has reinforced my understanding of secure software development practices.

### Action Plan
I plan to further explore advanced encryption techniques and key distribution patterns to enhance my understanding of how to secure data in distributed environments. Moreover, I intend to stay updated on best practices for securing virtualised environments, particularly through resources like OWASP and cybersecurity publications. By doing so, I hope to develop a deeper understanding of how to mitigate attacks targeting virtual systems and contribute to the design of secure, efficient distributed architectures in future projects.
