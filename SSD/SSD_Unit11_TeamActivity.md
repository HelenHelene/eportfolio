# Debate: Microservices and Microkernels

## Requirement
Read [Appendix A: the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate in DiBona & Ockman (1999)](SSD_Unit11_ActivityReference1.pdf) then read [Fritzsch et al (2019)](SSD_Unit11_ActivityReference2.pdf).

The forum has a message that says: “Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future. “

 - On the forum post a message either agreeing or disagreeing with the above and give a justification (ideally with an academic reference) supporting your view.
 - Outside the forum, discuss your positions in your team and come up with a team stance. This should be shared in Unit 12.

## Learning Outcomes
 - Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.
 - Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.
