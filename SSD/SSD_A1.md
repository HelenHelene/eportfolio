#### 3.1 Gathered Requirements

Table 1. Gathered requirements.	

#### 3.2 Missing Requirements
A domain model was created to ensure the completeness of requirements (Appendix 1). This approach proved fruitful in requirements gathering (Arora et al., 2019). 

Table 2 lists the missing requirements identified.

#### 3.3 Components List
The components list includes the elements for the proposed design, tailored to transform the gathered requirements into a practical solution (Appendix 2).

### 4. Gherkin Specifications
Figure 1 shows the Gherkin requirements for some of the critical functionality of our system (Rice et al., n.d.):

### 6. Development Plan
 - Budget: £500,000 provided by EDC
 - Timeline: 13 months
 - Deliverables: 2,000 Synputers purchased by EDC for £250 per machine

#### 6.1 Estimates and Project Schedule
The project will be delivered in 13 months. This timeline uses Brooks (1995) calculations to estimate the duration of the project's major stages (Appendix 3):
 - Planning Time: Tp = 13/3 = 4.3 months
 - Development Time: Td = 13/6 = 2.2 months
 - System Test Time: Ts = 13/4 = 3.3 months
 - Testing Time: Tt = 13/6 = 2.2 months (3.2 months, see explanation below)

Since the sum of the above values is less than 13, and studies show that inadequate quality control is one of the major contributors to project failures (Jones, 2004), the additional time will be devoted to testing, bringing it up to 3.2 months.	

#### 6.2 Cost Plan
The material cost is £157 per machine (Appendix 4).  
Assuming that the initial design, development, manufacturing, and testing costs are included (Appendix 5), the cost of the first 2,000 machines can be controlled at **£250 per unit**.

### 7. Testing Strategy
 - Prototype Testing: To obtain early feedback, we’ll perform prototype testing (Camburn et al., 2017) at various stages during the system's development.
 - Software Testing: Before release, all software development will go through rigorous testing by developers, QA Engineers, and QE Engineers (Beizer, 1984)
 - Hardware Testing: To meet customer expectations, hardware will go through reliability, functional, user acceptance, and certification testing (Hartman, 2005).

### 8. Pricing Strategy
To determine the pricing strategy for the Synputer, we considered the market price for PCs in the 1980s (Appendix 6), the production costs, and the industry average Gross Profit Margin (GP%) (Polymer, 2024).
Calculation: 
 - Unit Cost: £250
 - GP%: 50% for a competitive edge and healthy profit.
 - Sales Price: £250 / (1-50%) = **£500 per unit**

### 9. Conclusion
The Synputer aims to deliver a competitive, market-ready product within budget and timeline constraints, leveraging Agile methodologies to ensure flexibility and stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle. This proposal outlines the strategic approach, requirements, and comprehensive plan we will follow to ensure the project's success.
