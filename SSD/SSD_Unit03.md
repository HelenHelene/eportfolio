# Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design

In Unit 3, I gained an in-depth understanding of the evolution, concepts, and design of programming languages, with a particular focus on Python. I learned about the history of programming languages, from early machine code to modern languages like Python. I now have a clearer understanding of the key paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, and how they influence language design and application.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, I was able to:
 - Describe key milestones in the development of programming languages.
 - Outline key paradigms that define different types of languages.
 - Explain key concepts that determine the operation of programming languages.
 - Discuss programming challenges and recommended best practices.
 - Explain what design patterns are and when to use them.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities and actively engaged in collaborative discussions, , which are recorded in the link below:

[Collaborative Discussion 1 - UML Flowchart-Summary post](SSD_Unit03_Summary.pdf)

[Team Discussion - What is a Secure Programming Language?](SSD_Unit03_TeamActivity.md) 

[The Producer-Consumer Mechanism](SSD_Unit03_Activity2.md) 

[Exploring Python tools and features](SSD_Unit03_Activity1.md) (Not available)

### Reflections
Through activities like the discussion on secure programming languages, I explored the factors that make a language secure and how Python implements features like memory management and type safety to reduce vulnerabilities. This reinforced the importance of adopting best practices, such as input validation, avoiding functions like eval(), and using secure serialisation methods.

Additionally, the producer-consumer mechanism activity provided hands-on experience with multithreading and synchronisation, deepening my understanding of queue-based communication between threads. I also learned the value of thread-safe data structures and the role of locks in ensuring data integrity in concurrent programming.

The collaborative discussion on UML flowcharts and security measures introduced me to real-world applications of design patterns, such as implementing multi-factor authentication, session timeouts, and logging mechanisms to enhance software security. By aligning the activity diagram with OWASPâ€™s Top 10 Proactive Controls, I learned how to integrate security into software design effectively. This has been particularly helpful in preparing for the design document required in Assignment 1.

Overall, Unit 3 has equipped me with the knowledge and practical skills to design secure, efficient, and maintainable software while leveraging programming paradigms and design patterns.

### Action Plan
Unit 3 introduced coding exercises; however, I discovered that no IDE was provided in this module as before. As a result, I was unable to work on the Python buffer overflow activity due to IDE limitations. To address this, I plan to set up an appropriate IDE and experiment with these features independently.

I will also explore additional resources, such as OWASP guidelines, and apply them in my future projects to ensure secure software development.

The UML and design pattern knowledge I gained in this unit will be applied to the upcoming Assignment 1 for the Design Document. I plan to create more UML diagrams for different scenarios to enhance my ability to translate requirements into secure and efficient system designs.

By following this action plan, I aim to strengthen my theoretical knowledge and practical expertise, which will be essential for my future coursework and professional development in software engineering.
