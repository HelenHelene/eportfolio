# Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design

In Week 3, we explored the history, concepts, and design of programming languages, using Python as an example. We discussed key figures like Alan Turing and Alonzo Church, and examined paradigms that define different languages. This included the evolution from early machine code to languages like Cobol, Fortran, Lisp, and ALGOL. We also covered essential concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and reviewed best practices for security. Finally, we explored design patterns to improve software development.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit, I was able to:
 - Describe key milestones in the development of programming languages.
 - Outline key paradigms that define different types of languages.
 - Explain key concepts that determine the operation of programming languages.
 - Discuss programming challenges and recommended best practices.
 - Explain what design patterns are and when to use them.
