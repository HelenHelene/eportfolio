## Requirement
Please carry out these activities before joining the seminar this week. Your answers will be discussed during the seminar.

## Question 1: Table
Create a 2-column multi-line table. In the left-hand column, include the software development stages of the Scrum agile life cycle approach to project management. In the right-hand column, describe the processes which you recommend are applied at each stage to ensure that secure software is produced at the end of the development. To support the preparation of your response, you can refer to the following literature:

[Sharma, A. & Bawa, R. K. (2020) Identification and Integration of Security Activities for Secure Agile Development. International Journal of Information Technology.](SSD_Unit02_Reference.pdf)

## Question 2: Blog Post (also e-portfolio activity)
Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.

Select five terms from [ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27000:ed-5:v1:en) and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.

The posts made into this blog tool will be visible to all participants in this module. Comments from student peers and the tutor are encouraged.
