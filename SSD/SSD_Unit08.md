# Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems

During this unit, we explored the principles and applications of cryptography, focusing on its critical role in modern operating systems. We examined how cryptographic methods safeguard sensitive data, the use of cryptographic libraries, and the challenges associated with implementing them. Through a combination of theoretical discussions and practical exercises, we developed a deeper understanding of how encryption can be applied to enhance data security.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I was able to:
 - Identify and describe the issues encountered with cryptographic libraries, such as outdated algorithms or poor key management practices.
 - Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using common cryptographic libraries, considering factors like ease of use, security, and performance.
 - Demonstrate the practical application of cryptographic libraries by creating a basic Python program using the Fernet encryption method to secure sample data.


### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I participated in collaborative discussions and completed the following activities, which are documented in the provided link:

### Reflections
Reflecting on this unit, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of cryptography. The collaborative discussion on TrueCrypt highlighted the importance of staying updated with modern encryption tools and avoiding reliance on outdated or unsupported software. Analysing the vulnerabilities of TrueCrypt, such as weak key derivation and insecure memory handling, helped me appreciate the complexities of cryptographic security and the need for robust implementation.

The programming exercise allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario. I learned how to use the Python cryptography library to implement AES-based encryption with Fernet. This hands-on experience improved my confidence in integrating cryptographic libraries into applications while adhering to best practices, such as avoiding hardcoded keys and ensuring secure key storage. Additionally, I developed a structured approach to evaluating cryptographic tools, considering factors like performance, usability, and compliance with regulations such as GDPR.

Through these activities, I also recognised the importance of critical thinking when selecting encryption methods and libraries. For instance, I chose Fernet for its ease of use and secure defaults, but I also identified potential security concerns, such as key management and performance bottlenecks for large-scale data. Addressing these challenges requires a balance between theoretical understanding and practical application.

### Action Plan
To build on what I have learned in this unit, I plan to continue participating in collaborative discussions to stay informed about emerging cryptographic technologies and their applications. These discussions provide a platform for exchanging ideas and learning from peers, which enhances my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I will also explore more advanced cryptographic methods and libraries, such as hybrid encryption and RSA, to strengthen my understanding of asymmetrical encryption and secure key exchange.

Additionally, I aim to integrate cryptographic principles into future projects by applying best practices, such as secure key management and adhering to compliance requirements. To ensure my skills remain relevant, I will regularly review industry standards, such as those provided by OWASP, and seek opportunities to implement encryption in diverse scenarios, including securing APIs and databases. By doing so, I hope to develop secure, reliable, and scalable applications that meet modern security challenges.
