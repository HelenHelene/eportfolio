# Unit 11: Future trends in Secure Software Development

During this unit, we explored emerging trends and advancements in secure software development, focusing on the future direction of research and industry practices. We examined key areas such as secure design, development methodologies, programming languages, and operating systems, and discussed how these developments are shaping the field. Additionally, we investigated concepts like Fog Computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Cyber-Physical Systems, analysing their components, security challenges, and potential solutions. This unit also provided a comprehensive summary of the topics covered throughout the module, presenting a roadmap of how these technologies interconnect and identifying areas for further research.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I was able to:
 - Provide examples of Fog Computing, IoT, and Cyber-Physical System components and solutions.
 - Identify and describe security issues associated with these systems, such as data integrity, privacy, and system resilience.
 - Recommend emerging technologies and solutions for further investigation, based on their potential to address current and future security challenges.

### Artefacts and Collaborative Discussion 
As part of my e-portfolio, I have completed the following activities which are documented in the provided link:

[Debate: Microservices and Microkernels](SSD_Unit11_TeamActivity.md) <br><br> 

### Reflections
In the debate assignment, I explored the advantages of microservices and microkernels in modern software development, particularly their scalability, modularity, and fault isolation. I argued that these approaches align well with contemporary development goals, such as continuous delivery and cloud-based scalability.

The unit also encouraged me to think critically about the future of secure software development, especially how emerging technologies can address current challenges. By engaging in discussions and analysing trends, I developed a broader perspective on the interconnected nature of these technologies and their potential applications in real-world scenarios.

### Action Plan
To build on the knowledge gained from this unit, I plan to continue exploring emerging technologies like Fog Computing, IoT, and Cyber-Physical Systems, with a focus on understanding their security implications.  Moreover, I intend to pursue further research on the integration of secure design principles into IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems, as these areas are becoming increasingly relevant in both academic and industry contexts.
