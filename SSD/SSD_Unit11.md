# Unit 11: Future trends in Secure Software Development

Welcome to Week 11 where we will look at a number of trends and advances in both academic research and industry that serve as indicators around the general direction of research and development in the area of secure software development.

In this unit we shall:
 - Discuss future trends in the areas of secure design, development, programming languages and operating systems.
 - Explain what is meant by Fog Computing, the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems.
 - Explore systems and solutions that can be investigated as possible research topics or fields.

### Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
 - Give examples of fog computing, IoT and Cyber Physical System components and solutions.
 - Describe some of the security issues with the above-mentioned systems.
 - Recommend emerging technologies and solutions to investigate.
