# Unit 12: The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited

During this unit, we examined the longstanding debate between monolithic and microkernel architectures in the context of modern software development. We explored the historical arguments presented by Andrew Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds during the early 1990s and re-evaluated their relevance in today’s distributed, cloud-based computing environments. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between microkernels and microservices, considering how advances in secure programming and system design influence architectural decisions. This unit provided a comprehensive summary of the module and encouraged us to critically assess current trends in system design, weighing the trade-offs between monolithic and modular approaches.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this unit, I was able to:
 - Recommend a strategy for adopting either monolithic or microservice-based methodologies, depending on the use case.
 - Provide evidence and academic references to support my recommendation.
 - Explain how faceted data approaches work and their relevance to secure programming.

### Reflections
During this unit, I participated in two debates that significantly enhanced my understanding of system design and secure programming principles.

In the first debate (Unit 11: Microservices and Microkernels), I argued that microservices and microkernels represent the future of software architecture due to their scalability, modularity, and fault isolation. Drawing on academic references, I highlighted the advantages of decomposing monolithic systems into smaller, independently deployable components, aligning with modern development goals like continuous delivery and cloud scalability.

Building on this in the second debate (Unit 12: Monolithic vs. Microservices and Microkernels), I further supported the adoption of microservices and microkernels in today’s distributed systems. I analysed how combining microservices at the application layer with microkernel-based operating systems can reduce the trusted computing base (TCB), improve fault isolation, and mitigate security risks such as privilege escalation. The debates provided a platform to critically evaluate opposing views, refine my arguments, and gain a well-rounded understanding of the trade-offs involved in each approach.

Revisiting the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate gave me valuable insights into how architectural decisions affect performance, scalability, and security. I developed an appreciation for the historical context of monolithic and microkernel designs and how advancements in hardware and software have shifted the balance towards modular approaches. The discussions clarified how microservices and microkernels complement each other: microservices enable independent deployment and scalability at the application level, while microkernels improve security and fault isolation at the operating system level.

The debates also emphasised the importance of context when choosing an architecture. While monolithic systems may offer performance advantages in certain scenarios, the distributed nature of modern systems often demands the flexibility and resilience provided by microservices and microkernels. Additionally, exploring faceted data approaches reinforced my understanding of secure programming techniques, particularly how they can dynamically enforce information flow security in distributed environments.

Overall, this unit helped me develop critical thinking skills and apply them to real-world architectural challenges. It deepened my understanding of how emerging trends, such as cloud computing and continuous delivery pipelines, influence system design and development practices, preparing me to make informed architectural decisions in the future.

### Action Plan
To build on my learning from this unit, I intend to enhance my knowledge of secure programming techniques by investigating faceted data approaches in greater depth. This will involve reviewing academic literature and experimenting with dynamic information flow control methods in programming languages such as Python. Furthermore, I will stay updated on industry trends and best practices by following relevant publications and participating in professional forums.

By continuing to refine my skills in system design and secure programming, I aim to confidently apply these concepts to future projects, ensuring they are scalable, resilient, and secure in distributed environments.
