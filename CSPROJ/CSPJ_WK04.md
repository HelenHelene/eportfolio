# Structuring Your Literature Review

This formative assessment requires you to develop a skeleton for your literature review to provide an outline of the key topics and areas that you will cover.

### Instructions
 - Develop an outline of the remainder of your review, providing the headings and key topics that will appear in each section. There is an example of this included within the Lecturecast.
 - Estimate the word count for each of the sections that you have identified in your skeleton.

You should show an understanding of the topic and demonstrate your knowledge using appropriate academic references.

### Submission guidance
 - You will not be assessed for this activity, but your supervisor will provide feedback on your submission to aid in your progress.
 - There is no strict word count for this assignment, but you should aim to be **around 1-page of A4** where possible.
 - Referencing: when you have referred to other authorsâ€™ thoughts, ideas and opinions in your work you should reference using UoEO Harvard style.
 - Make sure you **email your supervisor** to make them aware of your submission.
