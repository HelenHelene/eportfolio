# Ethical Application and Research Proposal Submission

This formative, but compulsory, submission requires you to pull together the elements that you have created to date to form a project proposal. 
This will provide you and your supervisor with an explanation of the work you have to do and where you intend to focus your research for the duration of your project. 
The submission is due at the end of unit week 8. (See deadline details for actual date.)

Your proposal should include:
 - An introduction to the problem and the motivation behind your project, including your research question.
 - The project aims and its supporting objectives.
 - A skeleton of your literature review, highlighting key sections and the underlying topics.
 - An overview of the research methods that you will use for data collection and analysis.
 - A breakdown of your project into work packages, including a description of the artefact(s) to be created and your timeline.
 - The key ethical considerations involved in your project, with particular attention as to how to ensure the safety of any participants.

Please note that a Gantt chart or similar can be used for your timeline. 
This submission will not count towards your final grade but is a compulsory component of this module. You will only be provided with feedback on this element.

As part of the feedback for this submission, your supervisor will confirm if your ethical application has been approved. 
If it is not approved, you will need to make the necessary changes before starting your project. 
Failure to comply with the ethics approval policy will be grounds for potentially very serious action to be taken under the University’s Academic Offences Procedures. 
This means you cannot undertake your research without obtaining ethical approval.
