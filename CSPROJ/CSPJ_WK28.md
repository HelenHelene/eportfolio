# Dissertation Submission

This is part 1 of the summative project submission and accounts for 80% of the overall module mark.

Follow the link below to submit your original research project for grading. 
The dissertation is the culmination of your studies at postgraduate level and is the finale to what will have been a long and challenging road to reach this stage.
You have put a lot of work into the planning and writing of your dissertation and no doubt you will be relieved that this piece of work has come to an end. 
It is important to maintain your academic stamina all the way to the end to get the most out of your work. 
Before submitting your dissertation it is highly recommended to thoroughly proof-read your work, checking for spelling and grammar errors, edit any sections that you do not feel fit well within the body of the work and ensure that you check your originality level by using turnitin to check your plagiarism score. 
You may also wish to ask a friend or colleague to look over your work to provide an independent view point. 

These final checks are very important, as the dissertation represents a significant portion of your overall grade and every mark counts to ensure that you get the best grade possible. 
Some time spent conducting some simple checks before submission could mean the difference between a pass and a merit grade or between a merit and a distinction grade. 

**You need to submit your dissertation before the end of unit 28, which you can see on the deadline details page.**

### Submission Guidance
The dissertation thesis must remain an original contribution to the field of research. 
It is a document of **13,000 words** (see the Deadline Details page for more information). 
Dissertation Theses can vary in their structure depending on the research methodology and the discipline. 
As a guide, a typical dissertation would include the following chapters:

 - Abstract.
 - Chapter 1 - Introduction, Background. Aim and Objectives. A section should cover how your project meets the requirement of your MSc.
 - Chapter 2 - Literature Review.
 - Chapter 3 - Methodology. Research Design. Ethical and Professional Considerations
 - Chapter 4 - Depending on the typology of the Project, this is either to cover Data Presentation and Analysis or, in case of a more engineering-oriented project, the project specs and its implementation routines.
 - Chapter 5 - Discussion and evaluation of the results.
 - Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Recommendations. Avenue of future development.
 - References.
 - Appendices.

The word count does not include the bibliography, cover sheet, abstract (if used) or appendices.  
The word count does include: in-text references, tables of contents, quotations, footnotes, list of figures, captions and all other elements within the body of the submitted dissertation

It is expected that some key aspects of the code would be in the dissertation whilst the full code can be provided as a GitHub link/in the appendix.

Please refer to the Project Handbook (see Module Resources) for further guidance.
