# Defining Your Methods

In this formative assessment, you will begin to consider the appropriate research methods for your proposed project. 
This does not need to be a comprehensive methodology at this stage, but instead an understanding of the appropriate techniques that are available.

### Instructions
 - Select an appropriate methodology for your project.
 - In Computing, you have generally the choice of selecting
   - a traditional, typical research project (in which case you will follow the ‘Research Onion’ methodology as described in Saunders’ textbook).
   - Or, you can go for a more practical, engineering-type project, in which cases you will reason in terms of aim & objectives (instead of research questions)
   - and, will adopt one of the project approaches discussed in the Lecturecast and/or in this Unit’s readings (Agile, Waterfall, IBM-CRISP, etc).
 - Write an overview of your chosen approach including the data collection plan, where appropriate.

You should show an understanding of the topic and demonstrate your knowledge using appropriate academic references.

### Submission guidance
 - You will not be assessed for this activity, but your supervisor will provide feedback on your submission to aid in your progress.
 - There is no strict word count for this assignment, but you should aim to be **around 300 words** where possible.
 - Referencing: when you have referred to other authors’ thoughts, ideas and opinions in your work you should reference using UoEO Harvard style.
 - Make sure you **email your supervisor** to make them aware of your submission.
