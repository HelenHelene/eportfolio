# Draft Submission

Throughout the module your supervisor is able to provide feedback on each chapter of your dissertation once. 
This is an opportunity for you to ensure you are on the right lines and to highlight any areas of academic content which may need your attention before your submit your dissertation.

Please note, you must agree a reasonable turnaround with your supervisor, if you wish to gain feedback. 
It is not suitable to expect your supervisor to review your dissertation the night before the deadline date. 

Supervisors are not proofreaders and will not be responsible for correcting; for example, aspects such as:
 - Use of English, grammar or spelling.
 - Physical aspects of your dissertation e.g. margins/ font size.

Please used the Draft Submission Area to submit your draft submission and remember to email your supervisor so that they are aware you wish to gain some feedback.


### Instructions
