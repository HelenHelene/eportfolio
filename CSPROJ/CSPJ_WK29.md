# Artefact Presentation

This is part 2 of the summative project submission and accounts for 20% of the overall module mark.

Your work deserves recognition, hence the artefact presentation. 
The presentation also acts as a defence of your dissertation and includes peer and tutor review when carried out as part of an online conference. 
The format you use to present your artefact is dependent on the nature of the artefact itself. 
For example, an API development might need an audio-visual demonstration while a Mathematical proof would require a live discussion as you walk the audience through the proof.

Here, we have provided some [guidance on oral/live discussions, audio-visual presentations and e-poster presentations](CSPJ_WK29_ArtefactPresentationGuidanceDocument.pdf) as used across the University. 
Please note that this is guidance only and the final format would need to be discussed with your supervisors, regardless of the presentation format chosen.

### 1. Online Conference Details
Please Note: Supervisors are in charge of arranging a time and date for the Artefact Presentation directly with the you, the student. 
Once a time and date has been agreed between you, the supervisor must then pass on this detail via email to the Computing Department. 
The Computing Department require at least 2 weeks advance notice of the agreed Artefact Presentation to confirm Live Classroom availability and issue relevant invitations to the rest of the department. 
The presentation must take place on or before the deadline date, which you can find via the Deadline Details tab.

**Week 29** – Submit your presentation to the Online Conference, using a new thread within your Conference area. Deadline is Thursday 23.55.

**Week 29** – Review all conference submissions and post a question to at least one other submission in the conference. You can also respond to questions posted to your submission in the forum. Deadline is Monday 23.55.

**Week 30** – Live presentation/discussion of your artefact. This presentation is open to the Computing Department. You should ensure you have responded to all questions posed on your work in the forum. This can be done during the live presentation or written in the forum. Deadline is Monday 23.55.

### 2. Questions
At conferences, presenters are asked questions by the audience. In our online conference, we will do the same. 
Each student can pose questions to at least one other student about their artefact presentation. 
Although not compulsory, this adds to the camaraderie of your learning community. 
Computing supervisors will also ask questions of presenters.

The student presenter needs to respond to the questions and should be aware that their response will be graded (as part of your presentation/communication skill). 
You can respond to questions posted:
 - As part of the presentation (an additional 5 minutes can be allocated for Q&As during the presentation) and/or
 - In the forum (no more than 200 words per response). Written responses to the questions need to be completed by the end of the module.

### What makes a good question?
The conference Q&A is a valuable opportunity to rigorously evaluate research and open fruitful dialogue. 
A “good” question opens discussion rather than close it off. Yes/No questions are generally not considered viable in this context. 
Any good questions come out of engaged, active listening. 
Good questions are always respectful and polite even if you do not agree with what the presenter is saying. 
Good questions are never hostile and never belittle the presenter. 
Asking questions is not about being competitive or showing how clever we are. 
The aim of the questions is to understand the research in more depth and the whys, hows and so on.

Examples of questions you may like to ask are as follows:
 - Why did you focus on this research question?
 - What other research has been done on this issue?
 - Why did you pick this methodology as opposed to other methodologies?
 - Can you say some more about your analysis and why you choose this type of analysis?
 - What ethical issues could arise from undertaking this research?
 - What limitations do you think could arise from undertaking this research?

You can, of course, ask your own questions. The above are just examples.

### 3. Duration/Word Count
Your presentation should last **no more than 10 minutes**. 
Your written question to another presentation **should not be more than 200 words**, and your written answers to the questions asked in the forum **should not be more than 200 words each**.

### 4. Grading
Please see the Grading Criteria in Module Resources section to understand how your presentation will be assessed (Artefact Presentation Grading Criteria).

If you have any questions about the presentation, please ask your supervisors.


### [Presentation and Online Conference](CSPJ_Presentation.pdf)
The presentation and conference takes place on a dedicated presentation conference space to allow the entire Computing Department to take part if they so wish. 
Please follow the link below to access the conference space, to submit a copy of your presentation and to review and comment on other submissions. 
You also need to remember to answer any questions posed to you.
When accessing the conference space, look for the module code identical to this module. That will be the correct space for your presentation.
